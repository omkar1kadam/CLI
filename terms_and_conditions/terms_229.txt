THE ONLINE SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, MATERIALS, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ONLINE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ONLINE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR CORRECT; THAT THE ONLINE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE ONLINE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION


These Terms and Conditions shall be treated as though they were executed and performed in California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California (without regard to conflict of law principles).


We expect that our customer service team will be able to resolve most issues you may have using the Online Services. You can contact our customer service team as described in the “Contact Us” section below. In the unlikely event that an issue remains unresolved, we prefer to specify now what each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later. Accordingly, you and Mazda agree to the following resolution process.


In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of our issues, you and Mazda agree to first discuss any issue informally for at least 30 days. To do that, please send your full name, your email and/or mailing address, your concern, and your proposed solution by certified mail to us at: 200 Spectrum Center Drive, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92618-5004, Attn: Legal Department. If we would like to discuss an issue with you, we will contact you using an email or mailing address we have on file for you.


IF WE DO NOT REACH AN AGREED UPON SOLUTION AFTER OUR DISCUSSIONS FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS, YOU AND MAZDA AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT EITHER OF US MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORMATION, PERFORMANCE, OR BREACH OF THEM), OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER, OR USE OF THE ONLINE SERVICES MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION USING ITS CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES, AVAILABLE 
HERE
. AS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, EITHER YOU OR MAZDA MAY PURSUE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ANY CLAIM THAT IS WITHIN THAT COURT'S JURISDICTION AS LONG AS YOU PROCEED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.


NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE ANY PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS PENDING AN OUTCOME IN ARBITRATION.


TO HELP RESOLVE ANY ISSUES BETWEEN US PROMPTLY AND DIRECTLY, YOU AND MAZDA AGREE TO BEGIN ANY ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.


YOU AND MAZDA ALSO AGREE TO ARBITRATE IN EACH OF YOUR AND OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, AND YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.


Rather than force everyone to visit us in California, if you can demonstrate to us that arbitration in California would create an undue burden to you, we will allow you to initiate the arbitration in your home state. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in Orange County, California. Any disagreements regarding the forum for arbitration will be settled by the arbitrator.


If you initiate the arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules. Regardless of who initiates the arbitration, Mazda will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation.


IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BOTH YOU AND MAZDA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION ” SECTION. THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.


If the arbitrator rules against Mazda, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, Mazda will reimburse your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration. In addition, if the arbitrator rules in Mazda’s favor, it will not seek reimbursement of our attorneys’ fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration.


If you're not sure what all of this means, of course please feel free to ask an attorney.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE ONLINE SERVICES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT INDICATED ABOVE, OUR LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.


INDEMNIFICATION


You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, third-party service providers, and our respective employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors harmless from any and all liability, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise out of or are related to your violation of these Terms & Conditions or your use or misuse of the Online Services.


CHOICE OF LAW AND JURISDICTION


You agree that these Terms & Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws rules of any jurisdiction, and that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions or your access to or use of the Online Services will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within the State of California. You agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Because some jurisdictions do not permit the choice of law, jurisdiction, or venue, these requirements may not apply to you.


EQUITABLE RELIEF


You acknowledge that any breach or threatened breach of these Terms & Conditions will result in irreparable harm for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and, therefore, in addition to our rights and remedies otherwise available at law, we shall be entitled to seek immediate equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as appropriate. If we seek any equitable remedies, we shall not be precluded or prevented from seeking remedies at law, nor shall we be deemed to have made an election of remedies.


SEVERABILITY


If any provision of these Terms & Conditions is held unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or is so held by an applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render these Terms & Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or the applicable court decisions.


WAIVER


Any waiver by us of a breach of any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of these Terms & Conditions. Any such waiver must be in writing. Failure by us to insist upon strict adherence to any term of these Terms & Conditions on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive us of the right to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of these Terms & Conditions in the future.
