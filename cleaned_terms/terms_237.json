  "terms": "Okay, here's a draft of the “Terms of Use” section, incorporating all the elements and aiming for clarity and a professional tone. I’ve tried to balance legal requirements with user-friendliness.  **Please read the entire document before finalizing.**\n\n---\n\n**Terms of Use**\n\nThese Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your use of the Circle K Store and Alimentation Couche-Tard website (the “Site”) and mobile applications (the “Apps”) and any content available through the Site and Apps.

Governing Law**\n\nThese Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona.\n\n---\n\n**Important Notes & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Content Policy:**  A dedicated “Content Policy” is crucial. This policy should clearly outline acceptable and unacceptable content.\n*   **Privacy Policy:** Link to a comprehensive privacy policy that explains how you collect, use, and protect user data.\n*   **Legal Review:**  **Crucially, have an attorney review these Terms of Use to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.**\n\nTo help me refine this further, could you tell me:\n\n*   What are the key liabilities you want to emphasize? (e.g., liability for content, intellectual property infringement?)\n*   Are there any specific categories of content you want to exclude (e.g., child content)?"
