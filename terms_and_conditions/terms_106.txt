Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation
. We prohibit any sexual content or suggestive content, and predatory or inappropriate behavior involving minors (i.e. users under 18 years old) or someone who appears to be a minor. This includes sharing, offering, or asking for child exploitation content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM). If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor, do not share it. To report sexual, suggestive, or inappropriate behavior minors, you can use the in-line report feature on the website or app. When child sexual exploitation content is identified, the violative content is removed as soon as possible and the related account is banned. If we confirm the presence of CSAM, we take the steps required by law to preserve and refer the relevant content to appropriate authorities. In the United States, federal law requires that U.S.-based electronic service providers report instances of apparent CSAM to the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
 (NCMEC). NCMEC coordinates reports with global law enforcement agencies in over 120 countries through its partner organization, the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

12.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION
12.1.
Generally
. Except as described in Section 12.2 (Exceptions) and 12.3 (Opt-Out), you and Circle agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CIRCLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
12.2.
Exceptions
. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
12.3.
Opt-Out
. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 12 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to CircleCo, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 228 Park Ave S. PMB 52933 New York, NY 10003[A3] that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“
Opt-Out Notice
”). Once Circle receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 12 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 13 (Governing Law and Venue). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
12.4.
Arbitrator
. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, “
JAMS Rules
”) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at www.jamsadr.com, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting Circle.
12.5.
Commencing Arbitration
. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“
Notice of Arbitration
”). Circle’s address for notice is: CircleCo, Inc., 228 Park Ave S. PMB 52933 New York, NY 10003. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“
Demand
”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Circle may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Circle will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Circle has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.
12.6.
Arbitration Proceedings
. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Circle must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
12.7.
Arbitration Relief
. Except as provided in Section 12.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Circle before an arbitrator was selected, Circle will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
12.8.
No Class Actions
. YOU AND CIRCLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Circle agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
12.9.
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision
. If Circle makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Circle’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Circle will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
12.10.
Enforceability
. If Section 12.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 12 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if Circle receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 12 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 (Governing Law and Venue) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
13.
Governing Law and Venue
. These Terms, your access to and use of the Services, and any claim or dispute you may bring against Circle, its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, members, shareholders, agents and assigns, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York, and Kings County.
14.
Termination
. Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Services at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
15.
Severability
. If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.
16.
Assignment
. These Terms, including any rights and licenses under these Terms, may not be transferred or assigned by you in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Circle. If Circle sells its assets to or is acquired by another company, or if it merges with another company, you, by using the Services, authorize Circle to assign these Terms and the information you provided to Circle or that Circle collected while you used the Services in connection with such sale or merger.
17.
Consent to Electronic Communication
. By using the Services, you consent to receiving electronic communications from us regarding your use of the Services, or for operational and informational purposes. You also agree that by using the Services, you affirmatively consent to Circle using electronic records or your digital signature to satisfy any statute, regulation, or rule of law requiring that such information be provided in writing and that you have not withdrawn such consent.
