Vendor Master Terms and Conditions


These Vendor Master Terms and Conditions (including all online terms referenced in and/or linked to these online terms “VMTC”, “Vendor Master Terms and Conditions” or “Vendor MTC”) are entered into by and between Yahoo Holdings Inc., and its Affiliates, including Yahoo Ad Tech LLC, Yahoo Inc. and AOL Membership Services LLC (collectively, “Yahoo”), and Vendor as of the Start Date. Except for terms defined in the body hereof, capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Definitions Section of these Vendor Master Terms and Conditions.




SCOPE OF AGREEMENT. 
The Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Vendor will provide Services. All SOWs, Change Orders, SLAs, PLSSs, and POs will be governed by the Vendor MTC. In the event of an express and direct conflict between the terms of these VMTC and the terms of any other agreements for Services between Yahoo and Vendor, the terms of these VMTCs will control. Any Yahoo Company will be entitled to purchase Services under the Agreement by submitting a PO and/or executing an SOW, as applicable. Notwithstanding any independent references to “Yahoo” herein, Affiliates will have the rights of Yahoo under the Agreement to order or purchase Services and to enforce all rights and obligations with respect to any such order or purchase; provided, however, that Yahoo and Affiliates will be independently responsible for their respective purchase and/or use of Services. Vendor is a service provider or processor as those terms are defined under applicable data protection Laws, and Yahoo is a business or controller as those terms are defined under applicable data protection Laws.


SERVICES




Ordering.
 Yahoo will issue a PO for Services. Vendor agrees not to provide any Services unless Yahoo issues a PO for such Services. Yahoo makes no representations or commitments to Vendor as to the frequency of POs or the scope of Services that may be ordered. Any modifications to a PO must be in writing and pre-approved by Yahoo in writing. Upon Yahoo’s request for Services that are not Price Listed, Yahoo will issue a PO or the Parties will sign an SOW, as applicable.


Price Listed Services.
 If Vendor offers any Price Listed Services, Vendor will provide Yahoo written notice of such Price Listed Services, and Vendor and Yahoo may enter into a PLSS. The prices indicated on a PLSS will remain fixed throughout the Term and will not be subject to increase, unless the Parties execute an updated PLSS. For Services ordered pursuant to a PLSS, Vendor will deliver the ordered Services on or before the delivery date set forth in the applicable PO, or if no delivery date is set forth in the PO, then within ten (10) days of the PO date.


Production Services.
  Production Services (if any) shall be subject to the Production Services Terms as set forth in the Definitions Section below.  Any and all output from Production Services shall be considered Deliverables.


Service Level Agreement.
 The Parties may adopt an SLA as specified in an SOW, PO or at any time by written agreement. Once an SLA is adopted, the SLA cannot be amended, terminated or revoked except by a written amendment to the Agreement signed by the Parties. Unless otherwise stated in the SLA, Vendor will inform Yahoo, within one (1) business day, of any failure to meet any SLA. Vendor will issue Yahoo service level credits, if any, set forth in the applicable SLA (“SLA Credits”). Yahoo may apply any SLA Credits to any charges otherwise payable to Vendor by Yahoo.


Staffing.




Personnel.
 Vendor agrees: (i) to assign Personnel qualified to perform the Services; (ii) to maintain sufficient staffing levels to ensure Services are performed within the timeframes specified in the Agreement and at the performance levels in the SLAs; and (iii) Personnel will be supervised and controlled by Vendor. In addition, Vendor is solely responsible for: (1) the acts and/or omissions of Personnel; (2) payment of all Personnel compensation, including all legal and contractual benefits; (3) withholding any and all appropriate taxes; and (4) complying with any federal, state or local employment Laws as well as any other employer duties and obligations.


Subcontractors.
 Vendor will not subcontract the Services, in whole or in part, without Yahoo’s prior written approval. Vendor agrees to: (i) impose on Subcontractors obligations consistent with and at least as protective as with the terms of the Agreement; and (ii) ensure that Subcontractors comply with the Agreement. Vendor’s use of any Subcontractor will not relieve, waive, or diminish any obligation Vendor has under the Agreement. Vendor is solely responsible and shall be fully liable for the acts or omissions of Subcontractors. In addition, Vendor is solely responsible for the payment of any compensation due or allegedly due to Subcontractors, and Subcontractors may not seek payment (either directly or indirectly) from Yahoo. Vendor agrees to keep the Site and all other real and personal property in which Yahoo holds an interest free and clear of any and all liens and claims of such subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers; and if any such lien shall be filed at any time during the term of this Agreement, then Vendor shall, within ten (10) days of the date of receiving written notice of the filing of such lien, discharge, remove or bond off such lien to Yahoo’s satisfaction. Until such discharge or removal, Yahoo shall have the right to withhold from any sums payable under this Agreement any amount, which Yahoo deems appropriate to pay such lien and to pay all related costs and expenses, including attorney fees, and Vendor shall be liable to Yahoo for all such costs and expenses.


Removal.
 Yahoo may request removal and/or replacement of any Personnel or Subcontractor upon notice to Vendor. Upon such request, Vendor will immediately remove such Personnel or Subcontractor from performing Services under the Agreement and promptly replace such Personnel or Subcontractor with other Personnel or Subcontractor reasonably acceptable to Yahoo. Removal of any Personnel will not relieve, waive, excuse, or diminish any obligations Vendor has under the Agreement.






Inspections.
 Upon notification, Vendor will, within ten (10) business days or any less time required by Law, allow Yahoo, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), inspectors, regulators and other representatives, to visit Vendor’s facilities and inspect all records of Vendor (as well as Vendor’s affiliates and Subcontractors) that are held or maintained in connection with the Agreement, and Vendor’s facilities that will be or are used in the course of Vendor’s performance of the Agreement for the purpose of performing audits and inspections of Vendor during the term of this Agreement and for the period Vendor is required to maintain Records hereunder. Each Party will bear its respective costs associated with such inspection. Vendor shall provide to such auditors, inspectors, regulators and other representatives such assistance as they require, including installing and operating audit software. To the extent any audit report identifies overcharges or negative variances relating to Vendor's performance under this Agreement, Vendor shall promptly refund the amount of any such overcharge to Yahoo and otherwise promptly take those actions necessary to correct any negative variance.


Equipment and Services.
 Vendor, at its sole cost and expense, will provide all Information Systems, equipment, materials and/or facilities, as well as any support and maintenance of any of the foregoing, as necessary for its performance of the Agreement.


Hazardous Materials.
 If applicable, Vendor will: (a) provide notification to Yahoo if the Services include any material that is or can be hazardous to a person’s health or physical safety, even such hazard or injury that may result due to mishandling; (b) identify each such hazardous or injurious material; and (c) supply warning labels or instructional material appropriate to warn persons coming in contact with any such hazardous material of the hazard and its effect.


Yahoo Partner & Supplier Code of Conduct.
 Vendor will comply with the following Yahoo Partner & Supplier Code of Conduct at all times while performing the Services under this Agreement: 
https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/vendor/supplier-code-conduct/index.html 






DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE




Delivery
. Vendor acknowledges that time is of the essence with respect to the delivery of all Services. Vendor will package and label all Deliverables in accordance with best commercial practices. Unless otherwise agreed by Yahoo in writing, all Deliverables will be delivered F.O.B. to the destination in the PO or SOW. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by Yahoo, Vendor will pay all costs associated with shipping Deliverables, if any, including shipping, customs duties, and clearance. Risk of loss will pass to Yahoo upon Yahoo's receipt, inspection, and acceptance of Deliverables, as set forth herein.


Inspection, Testing, and Acceptance.
 Yahoo has thirty (30) days from the receipt of a Deliverable (“Acceptance Period”) to inspect, test, and accept or reject such Deliverable in writing. Vendor will provide (at no additional cost to Yahoo) such assistance as Yahoo may reasonably require while inspecting and testing any Deliverable. Yahoo may reject any Deliverable that Yahoo determines: (a) does not conform to the PO and/or the SOW and/or any Documentation; or (b) contains defects in materials or workmanship (collectively “Acceptance Criteria”). If Vendor is unable to correct a non-conforming Deliverable, at no additional cost to Yahoo, within ten (10) days of notification of non-conformance, Yahoo will, at its option: (i) be entitled to a refund of all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such non-conforming Deliverable(s); or (ii) be entitled to offset or adjust payments for such non-conforming Deliverable(s) against current or future payments to Vendor. If Yahoo requires an extension to evaluate any Deliverable, Yahoo and Vendor will work in good faith to agree upon a reasonable extension. If Yahoo fails to request an extension and/or does not provide written notice of acceptance or rejection by the end of the Acceptance Period, then the Deliverables subject to that Acceptance Period will be deemed rejected. For purposes of this Section, Yahoo may provide notice via email. Neither Yahoo’s acceptance nor rejection of any Deliverable will relieve, waive, or diminish any obligation Vendor may have under the Agreement.


Change Order.
 Either Party may request, in writing, revisions to a PO or an SOW (“Change Order”). Vendor will not commence and/or furnish any Services pursuant to a Change Order until Yahoo has signed the Change Order and/or Yahoo has issued a revised PO for such Change Order. Yahoo will not be responsible for any fees or costs incurred by Vendor or any permissible Subcontractor under a Change Order not signed by Yahoo.






COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT TERMS




Payment




Compensation.
 Subject to Vendor’s compliance with the Agreement, Yahoo will pay Vendor for accepted Services, based upon: (i) the prices and terms set forth in the applicable: (1) SOW, or (2) PO, and (ii) the terms of this Section. Vendor will promptly invoice Yahoo upon completion of Services or as outlined in an SOW. Amounts not invoiced by Vendor to Yahoo within ninety (90) days after such amounts could be invoiced under this Agreement may not thereafter be invoiced, and Yahoo shall not be required to pay such amounts. Payment for any accepted Services will be made one hundred and five (105) days after Yahoo’s receipt and approval of an undisputed invoice referencing the applicable PO number and itemizing all of Vendor’s fees and charges for such accepted Services.


Purchase Orders.
 All invoices must be submitted as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order. In certain cases, Vendor may elect, or Yahoo may require, payment through automated payment processing, in which event Vendor will promptly complete and deliver the proper ACH form to Yahoo.


Payment Disputes.
 If Yahoo initiates an invoice dispute, Yahoo will provide a written description of the disputed portion of the invoice. If Vendor incorrectly applies Yahoo’s payment (in whole or in part) to a PO number other than to the PO number referenced by Yahoo for the applicable Services, Vendor will promptly apply such payment to the correct PO and issue a written confirmation of such correction to Yahoo. Yahoo may withhold payments for any item(s) on Vendor’s invoice that Yahoo reasonably disputes. Yahoo’s non-payment of disputed items will not constitute a default and will not entitle Vendor to suspend or delay furnishing Services or terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part.


Late Delivery. 
To the extent that Vendor fails to furnish Services by the applicable delivery date or performance schedule, Yahoo will be entitled to a five percent (5%) discount off the total fees for the applicable late delivery/performance. Such discount will be refunded to Yahoo or, at Yahoo’s option, credited against future amounts owed, if any.






Costs and Expenses.
 Vendor will not be entitled to reimbursement for any cost or expense unless the cost or expense: (a) is set forth in the applicable PO or SOW; (b) if for travel or accommodations, was incurred consistent with the Travel Policy; (c) is detailed on the corresponding invoice and accompanied by supporting documentation; (d) is billed at cost; and (e) was previously approved by Yahoo in writing. All cost and expense items that meet the foregoing criteria will be paid in accordance with Section 4., above. Any cost or expense item that does not satisfy the foregoing criteria will not be reimbursed.


Taxes.
 All prices quoted to Yahoo pursuant to this Agreement do not include, and Yahoo shall pay, all applicable federal, state and local sales and use taxes, except any taxes or tax-like charges determined by or related to Vendor’s income, net worth, franchise, property or employees (which shall be borne solely by Vendor) (“Tax(es)”), provided such Taxes are due by law from a purchaser of the goods and/or services hereunder and properly invoiced and separately stated in accordance with applicable law at the time the goods and/or services are invoiced. If an exemption procedure is available, such as a resale exemption certificate, and Yahoo complies with such procedure, then Vendor will not invoice or collect such Tax during the effective period of the exemption provided Yahoo has supplied Vendor, and Vendor has accepted, a valid, duly executed exemption certificate. Vendor will bear any and all financial responsibility for interest and penalties resulting from its failure to comply with applicable tax law. If any payment to be made in respect of any invoice is subject to the law of any tax jurisdiction to any withholding tax, Yahoo shall make payment to Vendor of the amount owing on the invoice, less a deduction for the withholding tax, and Yahoo shall account to the relevant tax authority for the withheld tax. Payments of the net sum to Vendor and the withholding tax to the relevant tax authority shall constitute, for purposes of this Agreement, full settlement of the amount owing under the invoice.






CONFIDENTIALITY


“Yahoo Confidential Information” 
means any information disclosed by any Yahoo Company to Vendor, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or by inspection of tangible objects that is designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or some similar designation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Yahoo Confidential Information includes the terms of the Agreement and Yahoo Data, and may also include information disclosed to Yahoo or an Affiliate by third parties. 
“Vendor Confidential Information”
 means any information disclosed by Vendor, either directly or indirectly, in writing or by inspection of tangible objects that are designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or some similar designation. 
“Confidential Information”
 means Yahoo Confidential Information and/or Vendor Confidential Information in context as applicable to the receiving or disclosing Party. Confidential Information will not, however, include any information which: (a) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing Party; (b) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing Party through no action or inaction of the receiving Party; (c) is already in the possession of the receiving Party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing Party as shown by the receiving Party’s files, records, and/or other competent evidence immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (d) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party’s obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of or reference to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving Party’s possession. The receiving Party will not at any time (i) disclose, sell, license, transfer, or otherwise make available to any person or entity any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party (except to disclose or make available, in Vendor’s case, to Personnel and Subcontractors, who have a legitimate need to know such Confidential Information and are subject to an appropriate written confidentiality agreement or (where sufficient and legally permissible) are under a statutory obligation of confidentiality, and in Yahoo’s case, the Yahoo Entities), or (ii) use, reproduce, or copy any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party, except as necessary in connection with or as set forth in the Agreement. All Confidential Information will remain the disclosing Party’s property and all documents, electronic media, and other tangible items or portions thereof, which contain Confidential Information of the disclosing Party will be delivered to the disclosing Party promptly upon the disclosing Party’s written request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Yahoo will not be required to remove copies of Vendor’s Confidential Information from any backup media or servers. Nothing contained in the Agreement will prevent Vendor or a Yahoo Company from complying with applicable privacy and/or data protection Laws. The receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing Party in connection with subpoenas, court orders, other legal processes, or as otherwise required by Law, provided that the receiving Party gives the disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement (unless expressly prohibited in writing in such subpoena, court order, or other legal process) prior to such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to protect the Confidential Information from public disclosure, and provided further that any such disclosure is limited to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the legal requirement.


SITE ACCESS AND DATA SECURITY




Site Access.
 If Services are to be performed at a Site, Yahoo will permit Vendor reasonable access to the applicable Site(s) subject to the terms of this Section 6 and the Site Access Policies. Vendor will provide Yahoo a list of all Personnel and Subcontractors (including all Subcontractor personnel) that require access to the Site(s) and will maintain a current list, which will be available to Yahoo at all times. Any Personnel or Subcontractor failing a background check investigation, as required under Section 6.5, below, will be denied access to any Site. In the event Vendor is granted Site access, Vendor represents, warrants, and covenants that Vendor will perform its obligations without interfering with Users or Yahoo’s operations in or around the Site(s).


Identification Badges.
 All Personnel and Subcontractors working at a Site will wear a visible Yahoo issued identification. Immediately upon the termination of Personnel and/or Subcontractor who worked at a Site, Vendor will promptly provide written notice to the Yahoo Security Office, and return all security badges and access cards issued to Vendor for such Personnel and/or Subcontractors. Vendor will pay Yahoo a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (or the foreign equivalent thereof) for each non-returned or lost security badge or access card. Yahoo reserves the right to charge Vendor for expenses incurred by Yahoo in recovering any security badge or access card.


Network and Data Security.




If any Network-Data Communication occurs in connection with the use or performance of the Services: (i) such Network-Data Communication will be limited solely to Vendor’s performance of its obligations; and (ii) Vendor represents, warrants, and covenants that it will (and will cause its Subcontractors to) comply with the Network Security Terms. “Network-Data Communication(s)” means: (1) any Vendor-hosted interface which Yahoo or Users access; (2) any access to Yahoo’s Information Systems; (3) any access, communication, contact, or interconnection/between the information systems of Yahoo and Vendor; (4) any access/exposure to or communication of Yahoo Data, including any code or Intellectual Property; or (5) any Vendor access to any Site. “Network Security Terms” means Yahoo’s network security terms located at: 
https://www.legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/vendor/networksecurity/index.html
, which are incorporated herein by this reference and may be updated from time to time.


As between Yahoo and Vendor, Yahoo Data, collected, used, or stored by Vendor will be the sole and exclusive property of Yahoo. If Yahoo requests that Vendor complete and sign an updated Vendor data security disclosure form, Vendor will provide such disclosure form in the form and substance requested by Yahoo within five (5) days of Yahoo’s request, and any such Vendor data security disclosure form will be treated as Confidential Information.






User Data.




Vendor represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Vendor will not collect, use, retain, or disclose in connection with the Agreement any Personal Information without Yahoo’s prior express written consent; (ii) any collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Information will comply with the Agreement and all Laws; (iii) any collection, use, storage or transference of Personal Information, expressly authorized under the Agreement, will be solely for and/or on behalf of Yahoo and not for or on behalf of Vendor (or its agents, subcontractors, suppliers, or other customers), and Vendor will not, at any time for any reason, collect, use, retain or disclose any Personal Information except as necessary for the purpose of carrying out its duties as specified in the applicable PO or SOW; (iv) Vendor will not sell or share (as share is defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act) Personal Information or otherwise process Personal Information outside of the direct business relationship between Yahoo and Vendor or in any manner that is not permitted by service providers or processors under applicable Laws; (v) Vendor will not knowingly collect or accept information from children under the age of thirteen (13); (vi) Vendor will not, without the prior written consent of Yahoo, transmit or provide access to Personal Information to any facility outside the United States; and (vii) to the extent that the PO or SOW relates to any Personal Information from Users located in the European Union, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, Vendor will provide at least the level of privacy protection as is required by the applicable laws and comply with the terms of the Data Processing Agreement located at 
https://www.legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/vendor/dataprocessingagr/index.html
, which shall be deemed to form part of these VMTCs in such event.




Vendor shall not attempt to re-identify any Pseudonymous Data, Anonymous Data, Aggregate Data, or de-identified data processed under the Agreement without Yahoo’s express written permission. Vendor shall not merge any Pseudonymous Data, Anonymous Data, Aggregate Data, or de-identified data processed under the Agreement with Personally Identifying Information (PII). Vendor shall take reasonable measures to ensure that any de-identified data or Pseudonymous Data cannot be associated with a data subject. Vendor agrees to contact Yahoo to clarify data processing instructions hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any processing of Personal Information by Vendor under this Agreement shall not exceed what a service provider or processor may do under applicable data protection Laws.






Vendor shall promptly inform Yahoo if, in Vendor’s opinion, an instruction from Yahoo regarding Personal Information infringes applicable data protection Laws. Additionally, Vendor shall promptly notify Yahoo if Vendor determines that it can no longer meet its obligations under these Vendor MTCs, the Agreement, any applicable DPA or data protection Laws.




If Vendor receives any inquiry or complaint relating to Personal Information, Vendor will immediately notify Yahoo in such form and manner, and with such particulars, as Yahoo may require. If Yahoo notifies Vendor that it requires assistance in investigating or responding to such inquiry or complaint or any other inquiry or complaint received by Yahoo related to the Agreement, Vendor will fully cooperate with Yahoo by furnishing it with complete information concerning its collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information, including responding, if requested to do so, to any inquiry by a regulatory authority and/or to any complaint. If any inquiry or complaint gives rise to regulatory or court proceedings, Vendor will cooperate in the conduct of such proceedings, including attending hearings and assisting in securing and giving evidence and obtaining the attendance of witnesses.


Taking into account the nature of the processing, Vendor will provide reasonable assistance to Yahoo for the fulfillment of Yahoo’s obligation to honor requests by individuals (or their representatives) to exercise their rights with respect to their Personal Information under applicable data protection Laws (such as rights to access, correct, delete, port, and opt-out of certain processing of such data). Without limiting the foregoing:
			




Vendor shall, unless legally prohibited, notify Yahoo as soon as reasonably practical, and in any event within three (3) business days of receiving any request or complaint related to any Personal Information.






Vendor shall not respond to any such requests unless Yahoo authorizes Vendor in writing to do so, except to the extent Vendor has an obligation under applicable law to respond directly.






If Vendor has an obligation under applicable law to respond directly, it shall, unless legally prohibited, notify Yahoo of this requirement when making the initial notification and comply with Yahoo’s reasonable requests in responding to such request.






If Yahoo requests on behalf of any User that Vendor remove or delete any Personal Information from Vendor’s databases and/or records, Vendor will promptly remove all such Personal Information from its databases and records and direct any Subcontractors or other parties who have such Personal Information to do the same and confirm such removal and direction to other parties in writing, or as otherwise requested by Yahoo (e.g., API confirmation response, ticket number).






Vendor shall incorporate Yahoo APIs, reasonably requested by Yahoo, for purposes of Yahoo conveying and Vendor facilitating data subject requests under this subsection.








Taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Vendor, Vendor will provide reasonable assistance to and cooperation with Yahoo for Yahoo’s performance of any data protection impact assessment related to the processing or proposed processing of the Yahoo Data involving Vendor assessment that Yahoo believes in good faith is required under applicable Law or industry codes of conduct applicable to Yahoo. Vendor will, at the choice of Yahoo return to Yahoo and/or securely destroy all Yahoo Data upon termination of the Agreement or within 15 days of Yahoo’s earlier request, except to the extent that applicable legal requirements require storage of the Personal Information, in which case Vendor will (a) to the extent legally permitted, inform Yahoo of the legal requirement and of the particular Personal Information records that Vendor intends to retain, (b) not Process the Personal Information for any purpose other than compliance with the legal requirement, and (c) at the choice of Yahoo return to Yahoo and/or securely destroy such Personal Information as soon as practicable.






Background Checks.
 Vendor, and its Personnel and Subcontractors performing Services or providing work under this Agreement, will undergo a background check performed by a Vendor-designated firm and at Vendor’s cost. In addition, Vendor, and its Personnel and Subcontractors performing Services or providing work under this Agreement who require unescorted access to a Site (i.e., issuance of a Yahoo ID badge) or access to Yahoo’s network or Information Systems (i.e., issuance of a Yahoo corporate username/password), will undergo a background check (which may include identity verification, criminal records and civil judgments, professional license verifications, motor vehicle records, social security number, court records, military service records, other public records reports, and verifications of employment and education) performed by a Yahoo-designated firm, prior to such Personnel or Subcontractor undertaking any action in connection with the Agreement which require such access to a Site or access to Yahoo’s network or Information Systems, and all such individuals will sign Yahoo’s standard Non-Disclosure Agreement, agreeing to be bound by the confidentiality, non-disclosure and proprietary rights contained therein.


Anti-Spam Policy.

Non-Restrictive Relationship & Independent Contractors
. The relationship of the Parties is not exclusive. Nothing in the Agreement will be construed as preventing any Yahoo Company from independently developing or providing services which may be the same or similar to the Services. The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing herein will be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the Parties, and neither Party may create any obligations or responsibilities on behalf of the other Party.

 No waiver by either Party of a breach of any provision hereof will be taken or held to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision(s) in the Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of the Agreement. Moreover, if any provision(s) in the Agreement is held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity, or subject, it will be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable Law.


No Gratuity.
 Vendor represents, warrants, and covenants that Vendor, including its directors, officers, employees, and agents, have not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, accept, or give any entity a gift, payment, or anything of value to secure or influence the terms of this Agreement or the actions of a public official relating to this Agreement.

Vendor agrees it will promptly report to Yahoo and cooperate in investigation of any potential or actual violation of any anti-corruption laws relating to this Agreement.


Trade Compliance.
 Vendor agrees to comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and trade controls of other applicable countries, including without limitation the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security and the embargo and trade sanction programs administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Vendor will comply with the trade restrictions that prohibit direct and indirect export, re-export, sale, diversion, and transfer of items, software, technology, data, service, or funds under this Agreement to any: (i) countries (or its nationals) that are subject to U.S. embargo and/or economic sanctions; (ii) prohibited individuals or companies named on Government Sanctions Lists (“Prohibited Entities”); (iii) affiliates owned, operated, controlled by, or acting on behalf of Prohibited Entities; or (iv) end users (or for end uses) that Party knows or has reason to know are involved in military end uses or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Vendor represents and warrants that Vendor and any third parties it engages to perform under this Agreement are not: (i) Prohibited Entities; (ii) owned, operated, controlled by, or acting on behalf of Prohibited Entities; or (iii) subject to government export or import investigatory or enforcement activities. Vendor will provide Yahoo with all information that may be required for trade compliance purposes, including applicable export control classification numbers and documentation substantiating U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals. Under the U.S. export controls, transfers of certain export-controlled software and technology to foreign nationals are treated as exports to the foreign nationals’ home countries (otherwise known as “deemed exports”) and may require export licenses. Vendor will comply with U.S export controls regulating deemed exports, will obtain all export licenses that may be required before releasing export-controlled software and technology to its foreign national personnel, and ensure that none of its personnel working under this Agreement are identified on Government Sanctions Lists. “Government Sanctions Lists” mean government lists that identify individuals and entities subject to export prohibitions, economic sanctions, blocking orders, and other equivalent government restrictions, including but not limited to the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals List, Denied Persons List and Entity List.

https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/usdojruledpa/index.html
, which is incorporated herein by this reference.


Equal Employment.

These regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals based on their status as protected veterans or individuals with disabilities, and prohibit discrimination against all individuals based on their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. These regulations require that covered prime contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status or disability. Yahoo and Vendor also agree that, as applicable, they will abide by the requirements of Executive Order 13496 (29 CFR 471, Appendix A to Subpart A), relating to the notice of employee rights under federal labor laws.


Force Majeure.
 A Party will be excused from a delay in performing, or a failure to perform, its obligations under the Agreement to the extent such delay or failure is caused by the occurrence of any contingency beyond the reasonable control, and without any fault, of such Party, which contingencies include acts of God, war, riot, power failures, fires, and floods (referred to as a “Force Majeure Event”). In such event, the performance times will be extended for a period of time equivalent to the time lost due to the Force Majeure Event. In order to avail itself of the relief provided in this Section, the affected Party must act with due diligence to remedy the cause of, or to mitigate or overcome, such delay or failure. For purposes of this Section, due diligence will, require Vendor to maintain a contingency and disaster recovery plan for the continuation of business so that despite any disruption in Vendor’s ability to fulfill its Services obligations from any particular location or through the efforts of any particular individuals, Vendor will be able to fulfill its Services obligations from an alternative/backup location.


Governing Law; Jurisdiction; and Venue.
 The Agreement and any dispute relating thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict/choice of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement. Vendor agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New York. Any claim against Yahoo will be adjudicated on an individual basis and will not be consolidated in any proceeding with any claim or controversy of any other party.


Entire Agreement and Amendments.
 The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Yahoo and Vendor and supersedes any and all other agreements and understandings between Yahoo and Vendor, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Vendor MTC, and any PO, SOW, SLA, PLSS, or Change Order, the Vendor MTC will control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a PO, SOW or Change Order may amend Sections 3, 4, or 10.1 of the Vendor MTC only if the amended terms contained in such a PO, SOW or Change Order: (i) apply only to the individual PO, SOW or Change Order and not to any other PO, SOW or Change Order, and (ii) specifically identifies the provision(s) of the Vendor MTC they amend. Yahoo may change the Vendor MTC at any time by posting such on the applicable Yahoo Company Website or by email, and such revised Vendor MTC will supersede and replace the earlier Vendor MTC. Any provision of Services after such revision will be deemed to be acceptance by Vendor of the revised Vendor MTC.


Cumulative Remedies.
 The rights and remedies of any Yahoo Company under the Agreement are not exclusive and may be exercised alternatively or cumulatively, with any other rights and remedies available under the Agreement or in law or equity.


Counterparts & Conflicting Terms
. Vendor agrees that it is an express condition of this Agreement that any terms, conditions or provisions printed or otherwise contained in any quote or proposal (whether or not signed by either of the parties), acknowledgment, invoice, referenced online terms, or other document of Vendor, inconsistent with, in addition to, or altering, the terms hereof (collectively, “Conflicting Terms”) are hereby rejected, shall have no force or effect and are void, unless the party to be bound by those Conflicting Terms specifically agrees to such Conflicting Terms in writing following the Acceptance of this Agreement. To the extent that a PO might be treated as an acceptance of a previous offer made by Vendor, including by the execution of a proposal between Yahoo and Vendor, such Acceptance is expressly made on condition that Vendor agrees to comply with the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement and shipment of the goods materials or articles or beginning performance of any Services by Vendor shall constitute such Acceptance. Any PO, SOW, SLA, PLSS, and/or Change Order requiring signatures may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Vendor’s online acceptance of any or all portions of the Agreement will be deemed an execution for purposes of the preceding sentence. Vendor will not have the right to object to the manner (e.g., online acceptance, electronic signatures, fax, or scanned images of signature pages) in which the Agreement was executed as a defense to the enforcement of the Agreement.

 Captions in the Agreement are for convenience only and will not affect the interpretation or construction of the Agreement. As used in the Agreement, (a) “days” mean calendar days unless otherwise stated, (b) “include” and “including” mean “including, without limitation,” and (c) “will,” “shall,” and “must” are deemed to be equivalent and denote a mandatory obligation or prohibition, as applicable.
