About Our Health Content


OUR HEALTH CONTENT DESCRIBES GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH CARE THAT SHOULD NOT IN ANY EVENT BE CONSTRUED AS SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS.
 This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication or as a substitute for proper medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is for reference only and should not be used to determine treatment for specific medical conditions. You should never disregard, avoid or delay obtaining medical advice from a licensed practitioner because of information made available through the Services. The Services and its health related information and resources are not intended and must not be taken as the rendering of medical, nursing, or professional health care advice or services, or the practice of medicine, nursing, or professional health care in any jurisdiction. You should discuss the information provided with a physician, pharmacist, nurse, or other licensed health care professional. You should also check product information (including package inserts) regarding dosage, precautions, warnings, interactions, and contraindications before administering or using any device, drug, herb, vitamin, or supplement discussed on the Services.


You understand and agree that neither CVS Specialty nor its suppliers or vendors are responsible for any claim, loss, or damage directly or indirectly resulting from your use of the Services or the information resources contained on or accessible through the Services.


Proper treatment of health conditions depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your medical history, diet, lifestyle, and medication regimen. The Site and Services do not take all of these factors into account when providing educational information. Only your health care provider can best assess and address your individual health care needs. You should consult with your health care provider before starting a new diet, fitness, or supplement regimen.


Information and statements about dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition.

We specifically disclaim any guarantee or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any products or services sold, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. No information conveyed by CVS Specialty either orally or in writing shall create such a warranty.

THE SITE IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE INTENDED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, MITIGATION, OR TREATMENT OF ANY DISEASE, HEALTH CONDITION, OR HEALTH PROBLEM.


The Site and the Services do not address all possible uses, actions, precautions, side effects, or interactions of drugs, nor do they take into consideration your complete medical history or treatment plan.  The Site and the Services also do not provide comprehensive information concerning any particular disease or medical condition. You should consult with a professional health care provider prior to making any decisions, undertaking any actions, or not undertaking any actions related to any health care problem or issue or your medications.

Text Messaging Terms & 
Conditions


CVS Specialty offers access to specialty pharmacy service messages via SMS (Short Message Service) text alerts and email alerts.


Enrollment in text alerts requires patients to provide a mobile phone number and to agree to these terms and conditions.
Enrollment in email alerts requires patients to provide an email address and to agree to these terms and conditions.


These terms and conditions become effective upon your enrollment in CVS Specialty service messages. Upon enrollment, you acknowledge that specialty pharmacy service messages will be sent to the mobile phone number or email address you provide to CVS Specialty. Such messages may include limited personal information about your prescriptions, treatment or benefits, and whoever has access to that mobile phone or the carrier account or email address will also be able to see this information.


Once you agree to opt into this service, the frequency of informational alerts we send to you will vary by your prescription activity, the services you receive or your transactions with us. You will typically receive an alert when we have information for you about your prescriptions, treatment or benefits.


CVS Specialty does not impose a separate charge for text alerts, however, message and data rates may apply depending on the terms and conditions of your mobile phone company. You are solely responsible for all message and data charges that you incur. Please contact your participating mobile service provider about such charges. By agreeing to receive text alerts, you understand and agree that CVS Specialty may use an automatic dialing system to deliver text messages to you.


You will be allowed to opt out of this service at any time.

After you submit a request to unsubscribe, you will receive one final text message from CVS Specialty confirming that you will be inactivated in our system. No additional text messages will be sent unless you re-activate your subscription to text alerts.

Third Party Resources


The Services may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party sites, services, products, information, content, materials, merchandise, functionality, and/or other resources (“Third Party Resources”). These links and access are provided for your convenience and reference only.

Be aware that CVS Specialty does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about such Third Party Resources, including without limitation the security of any Materials, or the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on or made available by such Third Party Resources or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links or such access at any time. The fact that the Services include such links or access should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of such Third Party Resources, or any content made available thereby. Because some Third Party Resources employ automated search results or otherwise link you to Third Party Resources containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or made available by Third Party Resources, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such Third Party Resources. Your use of any Third Party Resources is at your own risk and is subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to such Third Party Resources (such as Terms of Service or Privacy Policies of the providers of such Third Party Resources).
























Governing Law


This Agreement, your use of the Services, all transactions through the Services, and all related matters, regardless of your location, are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws. This Agreement will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
























Dispute Resolution


ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; JURISDICTION AND VENUE.


PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. THIS SECTION ALSO CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR FINAL BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO PROCEED IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION (COLLECTIVELY, “CLASS ACTION”) IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION.


THIS SECTION ALSO ADDRESSES THAT YOU AND CVS ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW AND TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION SUBJECT TO THE LIMITED EXCLUSION BELOW. IN ARBITRATION, DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.


Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling Customer Service at 
1-800-237-2767
. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this Section explains how any Dispute (as defined below) will be resolved.


For purposes of this Section, the terms “CVS,” “our,” “we,” or “us” include CVS Pharmacy, Inc., its subsidiaries or affiliates, as well as any of their respective present or future affiliates or subsidiaries, and any persons or entities (including agents, representatives, or employees) related to CVS or its present or future affiliates or subsidiaries.


a) 
Arbitration Agreement. 
YOU AND CVS AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE (DEFINED BELOW) SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY ELECT TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THOSE CLAIMS QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION AND ADVANCES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS ACTION BASIS). ANY DISPUTE OVER WHETHER CLAIMS QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT IS FOR THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT TO DECIDE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND, IF NECESSARY, FOR A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO DECIDE.


You and CVS agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 
et seq.
, and federal arbitration law apply to this Arbitration Agreement and govern all questions as to whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.


For purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall include, but is not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and CVS that are related in any way to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, your use of the Site, sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, and/or any communications between you and CVS, whether occurring on the Site, in-store, or otherwise, even if the Dispute arises after the termination of your relationship with CVS. “Dispute” also includes, without limitation, claims that: (a) you bring against CVS; (b) CVS brings against you; (c) in any way relate to or arise out of any aspect of the relationship between you and CVS, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (d) arose before you entered into this Agreement or out of a prior agreement with CVS (including, without limitation, claims relating to advertising); (e) are subject to ongoing litigation where you are not a party or a member of a certified class; and/or (f) arise after the termination of this Agreement. “Dispute,” however, does not include disagreements or claims concerning patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property or claims for personal bodily injury, which shall not be subject to arbitration or the notice and informal process described below. The arbitrator shall decide all issues except for: (a) those that are specifically reserved for a court herein; (b) those issues relating to the scope, validity, and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement or any of the provisions of this Section; (c) any issues arising from or relating to the arbitrability of any Dispute; and (d) whether the arbitration administrator cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement—all of which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. This Arbitration Agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency.


Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution.
 You and CVS agree to engage cooperatively to try to resolve any Dispute informally prior to you or CVS initiating an arbitration proceeding. You or CVS must first send a written notice to the other party providing a detailed description of the Dispute; your or our name and contact information (address, telephone number, email address, and account number if applicable); sufficient information to enable you or us to identify any transaction at issue (including any receipts or purchase details); and a detailed description of: (a) the nature and basis of the Dispute and any claims and (b) the nature and basis of the relief sought (including a detailed calculation of any damages). Your notice to us must be personally signed by you (and your attorney if you are represented by legal counsel). Our notice to you must be personally signed by a CVS representative (and our attorney if we are represented by legal counsel).



Your notice to CVS must be sent to Caremark, LLC, c/o CT Corporation System, 330 N Brand Blvd, STE 700, Glendale, CA, 91203-2336. Our notice to you must be sent to the most recent contact information that you have provided to us.



For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of a completed notice from the other party, you and we will work together using reasonable efforts to try to resolve the Dispute. If requested by us in connection with a notice initiated by you, you agree to personally participate in an individualized telephone settlement conference (and if you are represented by an attorney, your attorney may also participate) to discuss a potential early resolution of the matter. If requested by you in connection with a notice initiated by us, we agree to have a CVS representative personally participate in an individualized, telephone settlement conference (and if we are represented by an attorney, our attorney may also participate). If the Dispute is not resolved within this 60-day period (which can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or we may commence arbitration consistent with the process set forth below. 
Compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is mandatory and a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.



 Any applicable limitations period (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.




If the sufficiency of a notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, such issue may be raised with and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either party’s election, and the parties agree that any arbitration shall be stayed pending resolution of the issue. The court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration. You or we may also elect to raise non-compliance with this informal dispute resolution process and seek relief in arbitration.




Arbitration Rules and Procedures; Individualized Relief; Fees.
 
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send an arbitration demand to National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) with a copy to Caremark, LLC, c/o CT Corporation System, 330 N Brand Blvd, STE 700, Glendale, CA, 91203-2336, or we must send an arbitration demand to NAM with a copy sent to you at the most current address we have on file. The arbitration demand must be accompanied by a certification of completion of the informal dispute resolution process and a copy of the notice. The arbitration demand and certification must be personally signed by you and your attorney, if you are represented by legal counsel (if you are initiating arbitration) or by a CVS representative or our attorney, if we are represented by legal counsel (if we are initiating arbitration). By filing the arbitration demand, the party and its attorney initiating the arbitration represent that to the best of their information, knowledge, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry that: (a) the arbitration demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (b) the claims or other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (c) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The arbitrator is expressly authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and their counsel.



The arbitration will be administered by NAM under its applicable rules, including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (“NAM Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The NAM Rules and fee information are available at 
www.namadr.com
. If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with the NAM Rules as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall agree on an administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree on an administrator, they shall jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will administer the arbitration consistent with the NAM Rules as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. 
Payment of all arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator may issue an award pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 and 68 as referenced in this Arbitration Agreement. CVS will consider a request to reimburse the consumer filing fee upon a demonstration of hardship. You and we agree that the parties have a shared interest in reducing the fees and costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or we may elect to engage with NAM regarding fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and your and our counsel, if you and we are represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all parties.



You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by a phone, video, or in-person hearing, or through written submissions, except any Dispute seeking $25,000 or more or injunctive relief shall have an in-person or video hearing. You and CVS reserve the right to request a hearing in any matter from the arbitrator. You and CVS agree that you and a CVS representative will personally appear at any hearing (along with your and our respective legal counsel, if the parties are represented by counsel). If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted at a location in the United States county where you live or work or such other location agreed upon by both parties.



The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply this Agreement as a court would and will adjudicate any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record only. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written award. The cost-shifting provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be awarded by the arbitrator if required by the Rule. The arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding that does not involve you and CVS. An award that has been satisfied may not be entered in court.



UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE AGREE OTHERWISE, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON CANNOT BE ARBITRATED JOINTLY OR BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER PERSON. ADDITIONALLY, YOU AND CVS AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD INDIVIDUAL RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE, OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S PARTICULAR CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT ISSUE A “PUBLIC INJUNCTION.” THE ARBITRATOR DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO VARY THESE CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS. IF, FOR ANY REASON, A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION HOLDS THAT THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF MAY PROCEED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF ALL REMAINING CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF.




Additional Procedures for Mass Filings.
 
You and CVS agree that these procedures (in addition to all others provided in Section) shall also apply if you choose to participate in a “Mass Filing” (defined below).



If 25 or more similar Disputes (including yours) are asserted against CVS by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“Mass Filing”), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filing set forth in the NAM Rules, you understand and agree that by choosing to be part of a Mass Filing, these additional procedures shall apply, and the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court if not resolved through the process set forth below. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer in an effort to informally resolve the Disputes, streamline procedures, address the informal exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated and to promote efficiency, conservation of resources, and the resolution of claims.



If your claim is part of a Mass Filing, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled for your Dispute from the time that the Mass Filing is first submitted to NAM until your Dispute proceeds in arbitration or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this Section.



STAGE ONE: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for CVS shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to proceed as cases in individual arbitration proceedings as part of an initial staged process. Alternatively, either side’s counsel may elect to have their 25 cases selected randomly. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this initial staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 100 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). Each of the 50 (or fewer) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed in individual arbitrations. If a case is withdrawn without the consent of both parties, then another Dispute shall be selected consistent with the selection process referenced above to proceed as part of this Stage One. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any administrative fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. If after this initial set of proceedings the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Disputes, they shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge to be jointly selected by counsel for the parties in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One), and CVS shall pay the mediator’s fee.



STAGE TWO: If the remaining Disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, counsel for the claimants and counsel for CVS shall each select 50 Disputes per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agree to in writing following mediation or through continuing, good faith discussions. Alternatively, either side’s counsel may elect to have their 50 Disputes selected randomly. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 200 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). No more than 3 cases may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually unless the parties agree otherwise. If a case is withdrawn without the consent of both parties, then another Dispute shall be selected consistent with the selection process referenced above to proceed as part of this Stage Two. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any administrative fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining Disputes with a retired federal or state court judge to be jointly selected by counsel for the parties in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two), and CVS shall again pay the mediator’s fee.


Upon the completion of the global mediation session set forth in Stage Two, each remaining Dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn shall be opted out of arbitration and may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of the remaining Disputes in individual arbitration proceedings consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel for the parties) or through another mutually-agreeable process.




A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Mass Filings section of the Arbitration Agreement, including by enjoining the Mass Filing, and the prosecution or administration of arbitrations.



The Additional Procedures for Mass Filings section of the Arbitration Agreement and each of its requirements are essential parts of this Arbitration Agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that this section applies to your Dispute and is not enforceable, then your Dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of this Agreement.




Opt-out.
 
You have the right to opt out of arbitration by sending your personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Caremark, LLC, c/o CT Corporation System, 330 N Brand Blvd, STE 700, Glendale, CA, 91203-2336, postmarked within 60 days of the first time you agreed to terms with CVS that included an arbitration agreement. You must include: (a) your name and residential address; (b) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (c) a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration and seek to have any Dispute addressed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. By opting out of arbitration, all other provisions in this Agreement, including the class action waiver and jury trial waiver, remain in effect to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law.




Severability and Survival.
 
Except as specifically provided in the Arbitration Agreement (e.g., the Additional Procedures for Mass Filings), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement is/are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable as to your Dispute, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement.




Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.
 
If we make any future changes to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to our mailing address), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice to the following address: Caremark, LLC, c/o CT Corporation System, 330 N Brand Blvd, STE 700, Glendale, CA, 91203-2336, postmarked within 30 days of the change. Such written notice does not constitute an opt-out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and CVS in accordance with this version of the Arbitration Agreement.


b) 
Waiver of Jury Trial; Waiver of Class Actions
. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND CVS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND CVS ALSO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ARBITRATION OR IN LITIGATION IN COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES RETAIN THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT.


 
























Copyright Infringement Claims: Notice and Take-Down Procedures


The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Services infringe your rights under U.S. copyright law, you (or your agent) may send to the CVS Specialty a written notice by mail, e-mail, or fax, requesting that CVS Specialty remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to the CVS Specialty a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing and meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see 
http://www.copyright.gov/
 for details), which, with respect to notices of infringement, currently include, among other requirements, the following:


Sufficient information identifying the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.
Sufficient information identifying the allegedly infringing material(s) and the location of such material(s) in order to permit CVS Specialty to locate such material(s).
A statement from the owner (or the owner’s authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed that such owner or authorized representative has a good faith belief that the allegedly infringing materials are used in a manner not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
Contact information for the complaining party, including a mailing address, a telephone number, and, if available, an email address.
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
A signature or the electronic equivalent from the owner (or the owner’s authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.


 


Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to the CVS Specialty’s DMCA agent as follows:


DMCA Agent, Legal Department

 Mail: CVS Specialty, One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, R.I. 02895 Mail Code 1160
