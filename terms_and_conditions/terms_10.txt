What Is a Terms and Conditions Agreement?


Terms and Conditions (T&C) 
– also known as Terms of Service, 
Terms of Use
, or End User License Agreement (
EULA
) – represent a 
contract between you, the provider of a service, and your users
.


They are a legally binding document and allow you to set your rules, 
within applicable law
. For example, they may help you define how users can interact with your product or service, how your original content can be used, or the rules concerning the cancellation or suspension of a user’s account.




Am I Legally Required to Have Terms and Conditions On My Website?


Unlike the 
privacy policy
, a Terms and Conditions document is not 
always
 required by law. But we can only recommend it! And here’s why.


We can safely say that 
Terms and Conditions are meant to protect you and your business
: they help handle potential problems arising or prevent them in the first place. Without it, it’s difficult for businesses to mount an adequate defense if sued or legally challenged over the use of their product or service.


In fact, it is considered standard practice and remain a very important document for every business, from a blog owner to an e-commerce store, in order to be protected from potential liabilities.


They are 
particularly crucial in 
cases of e-commerce stores
 because they contain legally required information related to 
conditions of sale
 and disclosures on methods of payment, shipping, delivery, withdrawals, and cancellation conditions etc.


Operating an e-commerce? Not sure 
what legal documents
 you need on your site? Check out 
this guide
.


💡 Whether your website engages in commerce or not, it’s always advisable to have a professional Terms of Service document in place on your website or app.

Reasons to Have a Terms and Conditions Document


Limitations of Liability


Terms and Conditions can protect your business interests and restrict liabilities for things like:




The 
scope
 of your services such as payment and delivery schedules; 


In case of 
malfunctions
 of your website/app; 




Inaccuracies
 and 
errors
;
  


Viruses, product 
damage
… 




Protection From Abusive Behavior


This can range from:

Avoiding having your content copied and protecting your intellectual property rights (logos, content). This is essential from a 
copyright
 perspective. 




Disclaimers


Your document usually contains 
legal statements
 that outline the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties involved in 
a particular agreement or transaction
. It also outlines governing and applicable laws such as federal or state laws. This is important if legal issues arise.


Further to that, another typical disclaimer usually states that the information provided is not guaranteed to be accurate or complete, and that the user of the information assumes all risks associated with its use.

What are the basic terms and conditions?






Despite how simple they appear, Terms and Conditions Agreements are meant to meet complex and highly specific scenarios. However, there are some basic clauses that most agreements should have.


In short, Terms typically contain copyright clauses, disclaimers and terms of sale, allow you to set governing law, list mandatory consumer protection clauses, and more. Keep reading for the full list on what your document should 
at least/at its most basic
 include.










How do I create a free terms and conditions?






To create a free Terms and Conditions document, you have different options such as free online generators or templates. You can also get a general look by studying your competitors’ Terms.


Customizable templates are sometimes made available by some platforms for free, while other websites provide free downloadable templates you can edit. Our own article has a free sample template you can use to 
get started
.


In fact, given that this document is quite complex in nature, 
it needs to be written very carefully
. Using free templates and generators has limits because they may not include all the clauses you need or match 
your specific business processes and model
.










What is the best way to display terms and conditions?






The best way to display terms and conditions is via a static link to your 
site’s footer
, so the document is easily accessible and always visible. In fact, a proper document won’t do your business any good if no one sees it! You need to make sure it is easy to find and placed in a prominent location.


Other options where to display your document are in a 
menu
 like the “About” or “Legal” sections of a mobile app, in 
sign up forms
 (“Create account” page during the account creation process), or checkout forms.










💡 Because each Terms and Conditions document serves as a legally binding contract that is meant to protect you, the business owner, 
it’s very important to make it specific to your company and keep it up-to-date
 with the various laws referenced in its contents. Learn how to do this

How To Enforce Terms and Conditions Agreements


Apart from having access to your Terms and Conditions document at anytime from your website’s footer, users will have to be presented with the Terms and Conditions in specific situations and asked to read and accept them. More information 
here
.




Common situations where to enforce Terms and Conditions include when a user:






 signs up
 for an account on your website;
    




downloads
 your mobile app;
    




makes a purchase
;
    


signs up for a 
subscription
.

Is it ok to use a Terms and Conditions Template?


Using a basic template is not 
wrong
 by default, but it can come with significant risk to you and your business. Should conflict arise or if a lawsuit is filed by a user, your Terms and Conditions document will be your 
first line of defense
. Terms and Conditions are complex legal documents that cover multiple legal scenarios (eg. commercial law, copyright laws, liabilities etc.), jurisdictions, and must apply to your 
specific
 business practices. 
This is difficult to achieve with a basic template
. 




Too many things to think about?
 Using just a Terms and Conditions template is too complicated and a bit risky?

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>Invalidity or unenforceability of any provision under applicable law will not affect the validity of other provisions, which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h4>US users</h4>
<p>Any invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. This document constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes all other communications, including but not limited to prior agreements concerning such subject matter, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h4>EU users</h4>
<p>If any provision of this document is void, invalid, or unenforceable, we both agree to do our best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions. <br>
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid, or unenforceable provisions will be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the above, the nullity, invalidity, or impossibility of enforcing a particular provision of this document will not nullify the entire agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential for it, or of such importance that we both would not have entered into the contract if we had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship for you or us.</p>
<h3>Governing law</h3>
<p>These terms are governed by the law of the place where we are based, as outlined in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>

<h4>Exception for consumers in Europe</h4>
<p>However, regardless of the above, this does not apply if you qualify as a European consumer or if you are a consumer based in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, or Iceland.</p>
<h4>UK consumers</h4>
<p>If you are a consumer based in England and Wales, you may bring legal proceedings related to these terms in the English and Welsh courts.

<h2>USER RIGHTS</h2>
<h3>Right of withdrawal</h3>
<p>Unless exceptions apply, if you qualify as a European consumer, you have the right to withdraw from a contract within a specified period (usually 14 days), without giving any reason. If you don’t fit this qualification, you cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
<h4>Exercising your right of withdrawal</h4>
<p>To withdraw from a contract, you must inform us clearly of your decision. This can be done using a withdrawal form or by any other clear statement. Make sure to do this before the withdrawal period ends.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Effects of withdrawal</h4>
<p>If you correctly withdraw from a contract, we will reimburse you for all payments made to us, including any delivery costs, if applicable.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from choosing a delivery method other than our standard option will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>We will process your reimbursement promptly and no later than 14 days after we receive your withdrawal notification.

<p>You are responsible for any diminished value of the goods resulting from handling beyond what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics, and functioning.</p>
<p>You will bear the costs of returning the goods.</p>

Do you sell primarily to other businesses, or only to consumers (B2B vs. B2B)?


Can your users sell to other users?














 Questions on Business Processes 






What are your sign-up processes?


What are the different account types (e.g. guest vs logged in)?


What roles can users have? Can they up-vote ratings, leave comments, report other users?


What are your payment options? (credit card, PayPal, gift cards…)


What are your return and shipping policies?














 Questions on Business Needs and Explicit Rules 






Are there different user levels (registered vs. non-registered)?


How is sensitive data handled when processing payments?


What are your expectations for user behavior (including comments), account termination and how your product/service/content may be used?


Do you take part in an affiliate program?


Can your products/content potentially cause harm if misused?


What is your governing law?












2. Make sure your document is complete and always up-to-date


A Terms and Conditions document is more than just a formality. It is a valuable tool that protects you as a business owner.


That’s why you should make sure to 
include all the clauses necessary
 to limit potential liabilities and 
update the document whenever something changes
 (including the law!).


💡 It’s essential to have well-written Terms and Conditions. The opposite could at best, not serve its purpose and at worst, potentially land you in legal hot water.


3. Consider using a Terms and Conditions Generator to meet your professional needs


We strongly suggest using a 
high-quality generator
 for creating a professional 
legally-biding
 document.


While nothing beats having a personal lawyer prepare and revise your documents, a quality generator with text written by legal professionals is the next best thing.
