What Are Terms and Conditions?


A terms and conditions agreement outlines the rules and expectations people must follow when accessing your website or mobile app and informs them about what they can expect from you.


Whether you call it a 
terms of use, terms of service, or terms and conditions
, this powerhouse document helps maintain control over your site as long as your guidelines fall within applicable laws by explaining the following:




Establish and clarify your 
intellectual property rights




Limit your liabilities


Outline your dispute resolution options


Disclose your governing laws


Establish payment terms


Include 
shipping policy
 and 
return and refund details




Inform users about your 
privacy policy




Outline 
acceptable uses, prohibited behaviors, and their consequences






It answers several common customer service questions and provides clear protocols if users try to take advantage of your operations.


It’s also required by some parties if you’re engaging in certain behaviors such as using an 
SMS broadcast
 service.


You can easily make one for your website or app by filling in the blank sections of a terms and conditions template with relevant information about your business protocols and guidelines.


Are Terms and Conditions Legally Required?


Terms and conditions agreements aren’t legally required, but it’s in your best interest to post one on your website or mobile app because it provides an additional layer of legal protection.


In the event of a dispute, arbitrators may consider multiple facets of your T&C document to determine whether each party acted within their rights.


While it’s not guaranteed to hold up in court, you have a better chance if you can prove your users read and agreed to the policy.


According to the American Bar Association (
ABA
), some specific legal disclosures apply to certain transactions and must be made as written statements, like stipulations outlined by:




The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (
DMCA
)


The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (
COPPA
)




You can add these disclosures as clauses in your website’s terms and conditions agreement.






Terms and conditions aren’t legally required, but 
privacy policies
 and 
cookie policies
 are.






Reasons to Have a Terms and Conditions


There are several reasons why you should post a terms and conditions on your website or app, as this document helps:








Limit your liabilities: 
Businesses can use terms and conditions agreements to limit different liabilities, which is why almost every one of these documents includes a 
warranty disclaimer
 and a 
no-responsibility clause
.




Protect your website against abusive users:
 If your site allows users to generate content, you can use your terms and conditions to establish appropriate and prohibited activity on your platform and explain your rights to remove abusive users and content that violates the guidelines. You might even 
make an acceptable use policy
 that’s part of your terms but can be shared as a separate document to explain community guidelines so your users know exactly what they can and can’t post to your platform.




Establish your intellectual property rights:
 Your terms and conditions agreement is a great place to disclose and protect your intellectual property rights, which helps prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement. Adding an 
intellectual property disclosure clause
 to your terms and conditions text informs users about what content, materials, and branding you own and don’t want illegally copied, reproduced, or shared. If you catch your users copying your content, having this clause in your terms and conditions agreement can help if you pursue legal action against them.




Create a dispute resolution process:
 A terms and conditions agreement helps inform users about your dispute resolution options and explains which laws govern your policy. This way, if a dispute arises between you and a user, there’s a clear process for both parties to follow. Any involved courts will use the governing law to interpret the terms and conditions agreement and its effects.






Clauses To Include in Your Terms and Conditions


The clauses you should include in your terms and conditions agreement varies depending on your industry and how consumers interact with your website or app.


To help you out, I’ve compiled a gigantic list of the most common clauses that appear in terms and conditions agreements.


Introduction Clause


Your terms and conditions agreement should start with an introduction letting users know what they’re reading, who you are, and to who the terms apply.


Within this clause, explain that anyone using your service must follow the terms and continuing to operate your platform implies they agree to them — this is called 
implied or browsewrap consent
 and is standard in most website terms and conditions documents.


See an example of this terms and conditions clause from the electronics company 
Apple
 below.




Intellectual Property Clause


Your terms and conditions should also have an intellectual property clause informing users about your ownership rights, copyrights, and trademarks.


Simply state that by agreeing to your website terms and conditions, users agree that:




You own all marks and ideas


They will not sell, modify, rent, loan, share, or distribute your content in any way


They will not use your material in any manner except for noncommercial, personal uses




Below, see a sample of how media group 
Vox Media Company
 phrases this clause in their terms and conditions agreement.




Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice and Policy


For websites in the U.S., your terms and conditions must explain that you’ll remove material that infringes users’ copyright according to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as required by 
US copyright laws
.


Below, see another sample of this terms and conditions clause from Vox.




User Contribution Clause


If your site or app allows users to create and share content, include a contribution clause in your terms and conditions explaining their rights over their posts.


Take, for example, 
YouTube’s
 contribution clause,  which explains what rights content creators retain over the videos they share.




Third Parties Clause


If your website links to external sources, put a third parties clause in your terms and conditions agreement explaining that you’re not responsible for the content on the sites you link to.


Below, see an example of how Vox discloses third-party links in their terms and conditions.




User Registration Clause


If your site allows users to create user profiles, add a user registration clause to your terms and conditions template to set proper customer expectations.


Here, you can remind users that their user credentials should always be kept confidential, they’re responsible for keeping it safe, and they need to contact you immediately if their credentials get stolen or someone gains unauthorized access to their account.


Below, see a sample of this clause in 
Spotify’s
 terms and conditions agreement.




Acceptable Uses Clause


If you allow users to interact with one another on your website or app, include an acceptable use clause in your terms and conditions to outline what actions and behaviors are permitted, including following other policies and terms.


Check out how the popular travel app 
Hopper
 informs users of acceptable use:




If it makes sense for your business, you can separate these rules into a 
standalone acceptable use policy (AUP) document
 that’s easier to share with your audience.


Just remember to establish that it’s still part of your overall terms.


Prohibited Activities And Restrictions Clause


You should also include a clause in your terms and conditions that explicitly lists prohibited activities to stop visitors from misusing your site.


Most companies will ban users for the following:




Advocating violence


Posting discriminatory, abusive, threatening, pornographic, or offensive content


Using the platform or site for illegal activities


Sending junk mail, spam, or chain letters


Exposing another user’s personal information, including username(s) and password(s)




Below, see another example from Hopper’s terms and conditions.




Suspension And Termination Clause


In your terms and conditions template, adding a suspension and terminations clause protects your site or app from abusive users by outlining your right to suspend accounts that violate your terms and delete their content.


You can also explain how users can delete or terminate their own accounts, which is particularly useful if you offer Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.


Below, see an example of this clause from the terms and conditions for the ecommerce company 
Etsy
.




Site Management And Support Clause


Add a site management or support clause to tell users how you run your site or service and to give users a better understanding of how your service works.


Companies typically outline the following details:




When they provide updates and monitor the site or service


When they perform routine inspections or system administration


Situations when they can refuse service or access to existing users and individuals


When they provide the service and when the help desk is available




Below, see how Spotify phrases this clause in their terms and conditions agreement.




Pricing And Payment Terms Clause


Include a section in your terms and conditions explaining your payment terms, like:




How you charge customers


What forms of payment you accept


Other relevant details




Use phrases such as “as available” for services and “as provided” for items to lower the chances of disputes.


Below, see a sample of this clause from the mobile service provider Spotify’s terms and conditions agreement.








For more help, check out our 
guide on writing payment terms for your terms and conditions agreement
.






Shipping Policy Clause


Your terms and conditions agreement is a great place to link to your shipping policy and outline some of your processes, as this helps answer common customer service questions.


Below, see an example of how clothing retailer 
ASOS
 phrases this clause in their terms and conditions agreement.




Returns And Refund Policy Clause


If you run an ecommerce website or app, put a returns and refunds clause in your terms and conditions so customers can always easily find this information.


Here you can provide a link to your official return policy along with a summary of your practices.


Below, see another example clause from ASOS.




Privacy Policy Clause


It’s a business best practice to add a privacy policy clause in your terms and conditions agreement and include a live link to the official policy to helps ensure your users can always locate this vital legal document.


See how 
T-Mobile
 phrased this clause in their terms and conditions in the screenshot below.




Keep in mind that there are additional guidelines you need to follow with your privacy policy because 
different data privacy regulations around the globe
 dictate the specifics.


Limitation Of Liabilities


If you manufacture and sell products, put a limitations of liability clause in your terms and conditions agreement, also called a 
no responsibility clause
.


Businesses use this clause to limit what customers can hold them accountable for, and it usually features standard language, as shown in the example below from Apple.




Governing And Applicable Laws Clause


In your terms and conditions agreement, you can establish within a clause what national or state law governs the contract between you and the users.


Most companies choose the law of their state or country or the country where users access their site or app.


See an example of this terms and conditions clause from Spotify below.




Dispute Resolutions And Indemnification Clause


You should also establish how you agree to handle consumer disputes within your terms and conditions. Typically this goes in a dispute resolution or indemnification clause.


Below, see another example from Spotify.




Corrections And Inaccuracies Clause


We’re all human, so within your terms and conditions agreement, include a clause that reminds users that you’re not liable for mistakes or errors on your site.


This section covers your back just in case there are any inconsistencies in your content, allowing you to update it with the correct information at any time.


Below, see a great example from 
our own terms and conditions agreement
.




Modifications and Interruptions Clause


You should also add a modifications and interruptions clause to your terms to limit your liabilities if users claim any loss or damage because they can’t use your site.


Here you can explain your right to change or delete anything on your site and states that users may encounter hardware problems and downtime.


Here’s another example from our own terms and conditions of how to phrase this section.




Disclaimers And Warranties Clause


A disclaimer and warranties clause in your terms and conditions lets users know that your site is available on an “as-is and as-available basis” and to use it at their own risk.


Essentially, this clause states that you are not responsible for any damage your service, product, or website may cause a user.


Below, see an example of a disclaimer warranty from Spotify.








Our 
free basic disclaimer template
 includes these terms and more.






Contact Information Clause


Finally, you need to inform readers how they can reach you if they have any questions or concerns about your service and policies, so put those details in a clause at the end of your terms and conditions agreement.


Below, see an example of this clause from Etsy, who keeps it short and sweet.




Terms and Conditions Agreement Solutions


Now that you know what goes into this agreement, let’s discuss the different ways you can make terms and conditions for your site.


Managed Solution


Using a managed solution, like our 
Terms and Conditions Generator
, is the simplest way to make one of these agreements for your website or mobile app.


You read through that giant list of clauses — making such an extensive document can take up a lot of time and effort.


Our Terms and Conditions Generator does all the hard work for you. You only need to answer a few simple questions about your business.




Our legal team added useful Tips and included answers to frequently asked questions in the policy builder, too. But if you need any help along the way, contact our customer service team.

Use a terms and conditions template for a simple, no-cost solution for your website or app.


Terms and conditions templates are free to download, fully customizable, and easy to use. Our terms and conditions template works for websites and mobile apps, features the most common clauses, and is written in plain language.

DIY


You can take a do-it-yourself approach and write a terms and conditions agreement on your own, which is a good approach if you have a legal team or run a unique business that requires non-traditional clauses.


But the cons of writing it yourself are hard to ignore — these agreements are challenging to make, and it’s easy to miss vital clauses.


For some help, check out our 
guide on how to write terms and conditions
.


Tips for a Good Terms and Conditions Agreement


Making a terms and conditions agreement can be tricky — here are some of my best tips on how to write a good terms and conditions agreement.








Use clear language: 
You want all of your users to be able to read and understand your terms and conditions, so use clear, straightforward language and avoid 
complicated jargon or unnecessary legalese
. This makes life easier for your visitors and strengthens your defense if users take legal action against you.




Use your brand’s voice: 
Your terms and conditions are part of your brand, so use the same style, sentence length, and tone as other pages on your site. This can help you build and maintain brand awareness and cohesion. It also will make it clear to users that the agreement was written by and belongs to your company.




Seek legal advice from an attorney if necessary: 
Depending on 
your target audience
, consider getting legal advice from an attorney when working on complex clauses of your terms and conditions. This is worthwhile for websites and apps that sell to minors, as there are specific requirements you must follow. For example, you must put a “Children” or “Youth” section outlining how legal guardians can consent on behalf of the minor before letting their child use your site.




Don’t copy terms and conditions text from another website: 
This is plagiarism, as these documents and other website policies are protected under copyright laws. Plus, another person’s terms and conditions most likely won’t fit your site’s needs, leaving you with inadequate protection.






Where to Post Your Terms and Conditions


Once you’ve created a terms and conditions agreement, you need to display it in a prominent area of your website or app, and I recommend the following places:








Website or App Footer: 
The most common place to link your terms and conditions agreement is in the footer of your website or mobile app because these are static areas that do not change no matter where your users end up. This is also where visitors typically expect to see a link to your site’s terms and conditions.




New User Account Creation Pages: 
Another great place to link to your terms and conditions agreement is during the sign-up or new user account creation process, as it gives people a chance to read your policy before joining your platform.




Payment Screens: 
You should link your terms and conditions to payment screens or checkout pages to set proper customer expectations and give them a chance to see and read the policy. This may help shield you from legal and financial risk, particularly if your terms and conditions have detailed pricing disclosures and site support clauses.




Privacy Center: 
There are lots of legal documents and web policies you need your users to be able to find, read, and easily understand, so house them all in one place on your website.




Inside Current Legal Policies: 
It’s a business best practice to also link to your terms and conditions in other legal documents on your site, such as your end-user license agreement (EULA) or privacy policy. Linking internally makes it easier for users to access all information and understand what they agree to.






How To Enforce Your Terms and Conditions Agreement


To enforce your terms and conditions agreement, if helps if you can prove that your users consented to it, read the contents, and fully understood what they agreed to.


Merely having a terms and conditions page and placing links throughout your website isn’t enough to get agreement, at least in the eyes of the courts.


You can obtain consent to your agreement by utilizing both 
the clickwrap and browsewrap methods
:










Clickwrap consent: 
This refers to having users actively select a checkbox in agreement with your policy




Browsewrap consent: 
This refers to using language at the beginning of your policy that states that users agree to your terms simply by accessing and using your services








You also need to ensure the formatting of your terms and conditions is easy to follow and that it’s written clearly and in a straightforward way.


Courts might also consider additional details, like if the link is easy to find on your platform and the different times it was presented to the user.


Terms and Conditions Examples


Taking inspiration from other sites’ terms and conditions can help inspire you when making your own, so let’s go over some great example terms and conditions agreements together.


McDonald’s Online Services T&Cs


First, let’s take a look at 
McDonald’s
 for a sample of a good terms and conditions agreement.


To keep visitors informed about updates to their terms and conditions agreement, McDonalds puts the information in a pop-up banner that appears when you arrive on their webpage, as shown below.




I also love how easy it is to read McDonald’s terms and conditions clauses, which are written in a simple, straightforward way that matches their brand, as shown in the screenshot below.




Throughout their policy, McDonald’s bolds parts of their content they want users to pay closer attention to, something you can consider doing in your own agreement.


See an example of this formatting in the screenshot below of their acceptable and prohibited uses clause for their online services.




AT&T T&Cs


Another strong terms and conditions example comes from one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies, 
AT&T
.


AT&T’s terms and conditions are incredibly detailed and comprehensive.


As shown below, the company uses a clickable table of contents to make their terms easier to navigate through. Consider doing the same if you have lengthy terms and conditions.




In their agreement, AT&T gives special consideration to passwords and security because it collects a substantial amount of personal data from customers.


At the same time, they limit their liabilities by controlling user expectations, as shown in the screenshot of their security clause below.




Apple T&Cs


Finally, let’s look at 
Apple’s
 terms and conditions for our final example, a tech company with a well-crafted agreement we’ve already referenced in this guide.


Apple’s terms clearly define what is considered an acceptable use of their services and what is not, as shown in the screenshot below.




I also like how Apple provides links to additional policies relevant to their consumers directly within their terms and conditions, shown below.




I recommend you do the same thing as Apple and put links to your privacy policy, shipping policy, and return and refund policies within clauses in your terms.
