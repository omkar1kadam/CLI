  "terms": "Terms and Conditions, what do they mean? Should we read them?\n\nIt’s usually thousands of words long, it can take you hours or days to read it, and you sign on average a dozen of them every year.\n\nTerms and conditions are a common part of navigating the social media sphere. Every time you want to visit a new website or download a new app you are usually agreeing to a new set of terms and conditions to use it. But what do those terms mean? Are they legally binding? And how often does the average consumer read them?\n\nWe reached out to the experts to figure that out.\n\nTerms and conditions agreements aren't just a boring read, but they act as a sort of legal contract between the user and the website.\n\n\"So it can be similar to signing a contract. Signing a terms and conditions type agreement if you are agreeing to those terms. Usually that's presented in the form of a button that you click on, which makes it more of an overt agreement like a contract,\" said Charlotte Tschider, an assistant professor at the Nebraska College of Law.\n\nSince it’s a legally binding document you should probably read it, but that brings up one of the challenges of terms and conditions, they are so dang long.\n\nSeveral studies have covered the excessive lengths of these agreements which can be long enough to take days to read, but the experts say despite how unreasonable the length, it’s still expected that you read them before agreeing.\n\n“Well the question around reasonability can be different depending on a legal perspective or a social perspective. The reality is you couldn't read every terms of use, one study showed it would take 76 days a year to read the terms you are presented with. On the legal side though if you are presented a set of terms and agree to them it is expected that you read them,” said Tschider.\n\nIt's clear not everyone is reading the terms, and there is plenty you miss when you don't.\n\nThe popular social media site Facebook has users agree to license photos they post on Facebook to the website, meaning Facebook could use those photos however they want, even transfer them to other companies, without asking permission or compensating users.\n\nAmazon has a unique set of terms in it’s lumberyard game software.\n\nThere is a special section highlighting that the software cannot be used on drones, medical devices or nuclear facilities... that is unless there is a zombie apocalypse occurring certified by the Center for Disease Control.\n\nNot every surprise found in a terms and conditions is a bad one, the website PC Pit-stop put a line in its terms and conditions agreement in 2005 awarding $1,000 to any user that read the section.\n\nIt still took four months before anyone noticed the agreement and collected the reward.\n\nThe experts we spoke to say terms and conditions are legally binding agreements and you do agree to them when you click the button saying “I agree”, so it's always best to read them carefully before signing.\n\nStay Connected\nLike Us\nFollow Us\nsbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign Up\n/sign-up\n© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.\nTerms\nEEO\nKHGI\nKHGI\nKWNB\nKWNB\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nLoading ..."
