You acknowledge and accept that use of the Websites is subject to the risks inherent in any connection and transmission on the internet, in particular in relation to security risks and vulnerabilities, technical performance and risk of interruption. Accordingly, neither PwC nor any PwC Parties are liable to you in any circumstances for any losses or damages caused by disruption or failure of internet networks or for any interruptions to or restrictions on the accessibility of the Websites arising for any reason, including, but not limited to, by reason of a virus, security related vulnerability, or technical or operational failure of any nature.

Indemnification


To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at the indemnified party’s option), indemnify, and hold the PwC Parties and their insurers harmless from and against any action, proceedings, claims, causes of action, demand, debts, losses, damages, charges, expenses and costs, including reasonable legal costs and/or any amount paid to settle any action or to satisfy a judgement and expenses of any kind and character whatsoever incurred by us relating to or arising from any content or information posted or transmitted by you using the Websites or otherwise arising out of your use of the Websites or use of the Websites by any third party who is given or gains access to the Websites due to your action or inaction. Your indemnification obligation to the PwC Parties includes but is not limited to any instance where one or more of your Submissions (a) infringes any Third Party Content or other third-party intellectual property rights, or (b) is inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful.


The PwC Parties have the right at any time to forego the indemnification and assume the defence of any claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is not the intent of the PwC Parties to affect the rights of the PwC Parties or their insurers to assume the defence or settlement of any claim against any PwC Party for which insurance coverage is sought under any applicable insurance policy.

Some jurisdictions prohibit the disclaimer of certain warranties or conditions or the limitation of certain types of liability. In such circumstances, to the extent that such prohibitions prohibit any exclusions and limitations in these Terms, such exclusions and limitations will not apply to you strictly to the extent necessary to make these Terms consistent with such prohibitions.

Applicable Law


The Terms and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with them are governed by the domestic laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any provisions that would require the laws of another jurisdiction to apply and regardless of your location. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of, and waive any rights based on, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, the Uniform Commercial Code, or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, however each may be codified or amended. ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND PWC UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL PANEL OF THREE ARBITRATORS INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT PWC AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude either party from seeking equitable relief in a court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution then in effect (“CPR Rules”). The arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators selected using the screened process provided for in the CPR Rules. The arbitration panel will have no power to award non-monetary or equitable relief of any sort, or to award damages inconsistent with this Agreement (including Section 16). Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. All aspects of the arbitration will be treated as confidential. You acknowledge and agree that any demand for arbitration must be issued within one (1) year from the date that you became aware or should reasonably have become aware of the facts that give rise to PwC’s alleged liability and in any event no later than two (2) years after the cause of action accrued.
