here
 and we will investigate the matter.


14. 
What happens if I am not happy with these Terms or the Services?


By using our Services, you agree to accept and be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with the Terms, you should not access or use our Services. We will do our best to resolve any disputes over these Terms. In an effort to resolve any issues quickly and amicably, if you have any issues or concerns about our Services please contact our Player Support team by opening a ticket 
here
. However, we understand that sometimes issues canât be resolved by our Player Support team.  This section explains how you and Miniclip agree to resolve those disputes, including where applicable, by binding individual arbitration.


You and Miniclip agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute informally in good faith for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration proceeding (the âInformal Dispute Resolution Periodâ). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the dispute. If Miniclip has a dispute with you, it will attempt to contact you by sending you notice of that dispute. In more serious cases, as determined in Miniclipâs sole discretion, Miniclip has the right to contact enforcement authorities directly or commence court proceedings if we are unable to contact you or if we deem it appropriate.  If you have a dispute with Miniclip, you must notify us in writing at the following address: Miniclip SA, ATTN: Legal Department, Rue des Beaux-Arts 8, 2000 NeuchÃ¢tel, Switzerland. Your notice must be individual to you and must include your name, your player ID and email address associated with your player account, and your residential address. The notice of dispute must also describe the nature of the dispute, explain the facts as you understand them, and how you would like to resolve the issue. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly during the Infromal Dispute Resolution Period. Your notice of dispute will not be valid and will not start the Infromal Dispute Resolution Period unless it contains all of the information required as set out in this section.


If the dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you or Miniclip may start arbitration proceedings in accordance with these Terms.


Binding Individual Arbitration


You and Miniclip agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator may award remedies to you to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. The arbitratorâs decision is final and binding, except that Miniclip may in its sole discretion commence court proceedings against you.


If you reside in the European Union (
"EU"
), you also have the right to refer the dispute to the EU's Online Dispute Resolution platform at: 
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage
.


15. 
Are there any other legal terms I need to be aware of?


Please read this section carefully - it affects your rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.


The Services are made available for personal and not commercial use. We do permit promotional references to our Services (for example reviews via social media and in blogs) but we do reserve the right to ask you to remove such content or refrain from further action.


You cannot assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any or all of your rights or obligations under these Terms to any other person.


If any part of these Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If that part cannot be amended, it will be deleted. The amendment or deletion of any part of these Terms shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the Terms.


If we do not enforce any right we have against you, this does not prevent us from enforcing this right at a later date. A person who is not a party to these Terms does not have any rights under them.


These Terms supersede and take precedence over any other purported terms between you and us.


These Terms and our relationship with you are governed by English law.


Class action and jury trial waiver
: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to only bring disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:






seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or






consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.






To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive rights to a trial by jury.


This section survives any termination of these Terms or Miniclipâs suspension of the provision of the Services to you.


16. 
How can I contact you?


For customer support queries, please use our Web Form available 
here
.


For business queries, please email 
biz@miniclip.com
.


17. 
Do I have to be a certain age to use the Services?


The Services are not directed at children. For some Services you may need to register and should be at least 13 or over to do so.


If you help someone who is under 13 to register for or otherwise use any Services you assume full liability for any consequences and that, under no circumstances including, but not limited to, negligence, neither we nor any third-party content provider nor their respective agents shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of such use.


18. 
Sunset


What happens when a game is shut down?


From time to time, we may take the decision to cease publishing one of our games and remove the game from all platforms and app stores so that it is no longer downloadable (we refer to the date that this occurs as the âSunset Dateâ).


How will I know when a game is Sunsetting?


We will always try to provide you a reasonable amount of notice of the anticipated Sunset Date for a game, whether this notice occurs as an in-game pop-up and/or official announcement by Miniclip on the relevant support page for the game or Miniclipâs social media channels. Where the game is available on the Facebook platform, we will announce the Sunset Date on the gameâs Facebook community page.
Any announcement will explain the impending closure of the game on the Sunset Date and urge all players to stop making any in-game purchases.


Can I get a refund on my in-game purchases?


You will be entitled to a full refund for any in-app items or Subscriptions purchased in the two (2) month period leading up to the Sunset Date. All refund requests must be made through the relevant app store or by opening a ticket with the Miniclip support team.
Please note, you only have thirty (30) days after the Sunset Date of a game to make your claim, otherwise you will lose your entitlement to any refund. The reason for this is to ensure that we can abide by applicable Data Protection laws and delete all personal data collected from the game from our servers and database.
Please visit the Privacy Policy page for more information about your personal data (
https://m.miniclip.com/privacy/
).


I have more questions about sunsetting, where can I ask them?


You can contact our Player Experience Support team by opening a ticket at the following link: 
https://support.miniclip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
.


19. 
Bots


Like many of our peers in the mobile games industry, we use bots in our games in certain circumstances. The majority of the games offered by Miniclip are real-time multiplayer games. As is standard for such games, bots may be used if there are no real-live players available, in instances of low connectivity or in the event of other technical constraints so that we can ensure smooth and enjoyable gameplay for our users.

Please read these terms and conditions ("Virtual Items Terms") carefully before purchasing any virtual items, benefits, upgrades, unlockables, cosmetics, skins, gameplay features or coins, cash, tokens or other in-game currency ("Coins"), in each case, available through or otherwise in relation to our Services (together "Virtual Items"). By directly or indirectly (such as through Subscriptions) purchasing any Virtual Items, you agree to be bound by these Virtual Items Terms and the 
Terms
. These Virtual Items Terms are in addition to the Terms and if there is a conflict between the Virtual Items Terms and the Terms, the Virtual Items Terms shall apply.


1. 
When do these Virtual Items Terms apply?


These Virtual Items Terms cover your purchase and use of Virtual Items. Please be aware that a number of our Services have more than one type of in-game currency. If this is the case, there will be different items which can be purchased with each type of in-game currency, and each may be acquired in different ways.


Coins and items can only be used in line with these Virtual Items Terms and within the game account in which they are purchased or otherwise acquired. You acknowledge that certain additional in-game functionality may only be accessible in exchange for Coins.


These Virtual Items Terms also apply if you win or are given any Virtual Items because you have participated in a gameplay feature, competition, survey or marketing campaign.


Please note some of our Services may include âloot boxesâ as part of the Virtual Items offered in the game. Loot boxes can take various forms (such as golf bags, treasure chests or player packs) are usually considered to be a form of randomised in-game content you can open or redeem through various means, including for example for in-game currency, coins, or through gameplay. Loot boxes are subject to these Virtual Items Terms.


2. 
Where can I buy Virtual Items?


Some of our games let you buy Virtual Items. You can recognise these games because they have an option to purchase Virtual Items, either in an in-game shop or, in the case of Coins, usually at the top of the specific game playing window. Games may allow you to buy different amounts of Virtual Items and may have temporary offers or sales for Virtual Item purchases.


Please note that when purchasing Virtual Items through one of our games, which you have downloaded from an app store, there may be additional terms and conditions which apply. You may be asked to agree to the app store provider's own terms and conditions, which will apply in addition to these Virtual Items Terms. We suggest you read app store terms carefully and follow the process provided by the relevant app store.


We do not permit third parties to give or sell Coins and other Virtual Items outside of our games. Accordingly, as a condition to playing our games, you agree not to receive, purchase and/or use Coins or Virtual Items from such third parties. Any unauthorised Coins or Virtual Items that you purchase are subject to forfeiture at any time.


3. 
I am ready to buy Virtual Items â what do I need to do?


You can buy Virtual Items from us for real money if you are 18 years of age or older or, if you are under 18, have the permission of a parent or guardian. We may ask you to provide the details of your parent or guardian from time to time.


If you want to buy any Virtual Items, please follow the steps set out in the game which you have downloaded. If you experience any difficulties when purchasing Virtual Items, you can contact us 
here
.


Please note the following:




You may be presented with multiple Virtual Items bundles, with different virtual currency options if applicable, and with different prices and amounts of Virtual Items to choose from. Please select the bundle that you wish to purchase, review this selection and, if you are happy, please proceed to check out. If you are purchasing Virtual Items through the Website, you will automatically be redirected to our third-party payment provider website. If you are purchasing Virtual Items through an app, your payment will be processed through the applicable app store and additional app store terms and conditions may apply.


The price of Virtual Items is as stated at the time you place your order, except in the case of obvious error. We try and ensure that all prices stated are accurate but errors may occur. The price includes value added tax (where applicable).


We are entitled to change the purchase price for Virtual Items at any time, before you purchase the Virtual Items. At the time of purchase of Virtual Items, you may be offered additional Virtual Items free of charge. These Virtual Items Terms cover such additional Virtual Items offered free of charge. Subject to applicable law and regulation, the price of Virtual Items may vary between users depending on a number of factors including differing exchange rates, territories and legal limitations.


If you are purchasing Virtual Items through a third-party payment provider window, you will be asked to select your preferred payment method. Note that such payment methods are subject to change at the discretion of Miniclip and the third-party payment provider.


Please select the payment method that you wish to use by clicking on the relevant icon. By doing so you confirm that you are authorised to use the payment method selected. You will then be asked to provide certain required information to purchase the Virtual Items. If you are paying by credit card please enter the number in full, without spaces or dashes. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorise payment we will not accept your Virtual Item order and we are not obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal.


We are not responsible for your card issuer or bank charging you as a result of the processing of your credit/debit card payment in accordance with your order. Before placing and submitting an order for Virtual Items, you will be provided with details of the terms and conditions of our third-party payment provider. You will need to read and accept these terms and conditions before purchasing the Virtual Items through our third-party payment provider.


Please check the accuracy of the payment information that you have provided and correct any mistakes. When you are ready, please click to submit your order. By doing so you: (i) agree to be bound by the Terms and these Virtual Items Terms; (ii) agree to pay for the Virtual Items at the indicated price, and you (iii) confirm that you are permitted to use the payment source that you have provided; and (iv) you authorise our designated payment processor to charge the full amount to the payment source you have identified for the transaction.


Once you have placed your order, you will receive a confirmation on screen.


All purchased or allocated Virtual Items will be assigned to the account that is linked with the payment provider through which the purchase or allocation is made. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are logged in to the correct account when making a purchase.


Miniclip does not process payments. A third-party payment provider or the app store itself (such as Apple or Google Play Store) handles payments. If you have any issues or problems with payment for a Virtual Item, you should therefore contact the third-party payment provider or the app store directly.




4. 
Can I transfer Virtual Items between app and website accounts?


Generally, no. The app and website accounts are not always linked, but in some cases, such as for 8 Ball Pool, the Coin wallets are linked. However, for some games there is no link, and if you purchase Virtual Items through one platform account, they will not appear in other platform accounts you may have with us.


5. 
How do I use my Virtual Items?


You can spend your Coins in order to acquire other Virtual Items within the game within which you purchased the Coins. When you use Coins to acquire another Virtual Item within a game, the relevant amount of Coins will automatically be deducted from your account that is connected with that game.


Other than Coins, the nature and duration of any Virtual Items will vary between and within our games. Some Virtual Items may only be used a limited number of times or only whilst you satisfy certain conditions within the relevant game.


We can at any time, without notifying you, vary the scope, variety and type of Virtual Items. Miniclip has no obligation to make, or continue to make, any specific Virtual Item for any game. We may also restrict or vary the type of Virtual Items available to you based on your country of residence.


6. 
What am I not allowed to do with my Virtual Items?


By buying Virtual Items, you agree not to:




transfer Virtual Items between accounts or between you and any other person, except for any Miniclip authorized and enabled transfers between games;


transfer or attempt to transfer Virtual Items between two or more accounts in any way; or


transfer Virtual Items between accounts by any means that attempts to bypass normal playing rules or that is contrary to the general purpose of a game (for example: by using one account to intentionally lose a game to another account for the purpose of transferring credits between the accounts).




Users are prohibited from holding and using Virtual Items in multiple accounts in any manner that is contrary to the general purpose of the Miniclip game and in violation of any relevant clauses of these Terms and Conditions.


You are strictly prohibited from giving, selling or otherwise transferring an account or any Virtual Items to any other person. Any violation or abuse of the account limitations will be flagged and may result in suspending or disabling your account or any other measures Miniclip deems necessary.


We may from time to time limit the use of Virtual Items, including applying limits to the number of Virtual Items allocated to your account at any time, and/or the number of Virtual Items usable or redeemable within a given time period.


7. 
What legal terms do I need to be aware of when I am purchasing Virtual Items?


When you buy Virtual Items, you are buying a limited personal revocable licence to use the Virtual Items. You agree that the Virtual Items do not constitute personal property and Coins are not legal tender or currency of any kind. 
All Virtual Items purchased by you are non-refundable.
 No interest is paid or earned on any Coins balance.


Miniclip is entitled to expire, withdraw, replace, restrict or otherwise change any Virtual Item at any time.


You have certain rights in respect of the Virtual Items. These include that we have the right to supply the Virtual Items to you and that the Virtual Items will be of satisfactory quality and as described.


You have certain legal remedies if we breach any of these rights. Nothing in these Virtual Items Terms is intended to affect these legal rights or other rights to which you may also be entitled.


If we are unable to resolve any disputes between us about your purchase of the Virtual Items or these Virtual Items Terms, you have the right to refer the dispute to the EU's Online Dispute Resolution platform at 
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage
.


8. 
Can I cancel my order once I have bought my Virtual Items?


By purchasing Virtual Items from us, you agree that we can transfer them to your account as soon as we can. By agreeing to these terms, each time you click to confirm a purchase, you acknowledge that you expressly consent to the supply of the Virtual Items immediately and acknowledge that you will lose your right to change your mind and cancel such order within the 14-day cooling-off period otherwise provided by law.


9. 
What happens to my Virtual Items if my account is temporarily or permanently terminated?


We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban your account if:




we or our designated payment processor are unable to verify or authenticate any information (including payment information) you provide in connection with the purchase or use of the relevant Virtual Items;


we or our designated payment processor are notified of or reasonably suspects any cheating, fraudulent, abusive or other unlawful activity whatsoever in relation to your account, Virtual Items or Coins balance;




you are otherwise in breach of these Virtual Items Terms, the terms of the third-party payment service provider or any other Terms; or




your account is inactive for a period of 3 years.




If we temporarily or permanently ban your account, we may remove any or all of the Virtual Items in your account. If this happens, you are not entitled to any reimbursement, refund or any other compensation, except at our sole discretion.


10. 
What do I do if I have not received my Virtual Items?


It is possible that you have successfully ordered and paid for your Coins, but you may not have received them. Please remember that during busy periods, it can take up to 48 hours before your Virtual Items are assigned to your account. If you are still having issues receiving your Virtual Items and you have not received them after a short period of time, please let us know by contacting us 
here
.


11. 
What should I do if someone has made an unauthorised purchase on my account?


You are responsible for the security of your account and ensuring that no unauthorised purchases occur on your account. Miniclip is not liable for any unauthorised purchases (including fraudulent purchases or purchases made by minors). If you wish to pursue a refund for such purchases, you should contact your bank or the payment provider such as the relevant app store.


12. 
What is Miniclip not responsible for?


We are not responsible for the following types of loss or damage which may arise (and have no obligation to refund for any purchase of Virtual Items):




damage or loss not caused by our breach of the Virtual Items Terms;


unauthorised purchases made by persons who have gained access to your account (including, without limitation, minors or unauthorised third parties);


loss of progress or Virtual Items on your guest account which you can no longer access. We advise you to create a proper account and/or to link your account to Facebook to minimise loss of your account data;


loss of progress or Virtual Items due to disconnecting your game account from a social media account (such as Google or Facebook);


loss or liability incurred by you as a result of accidentally entering a match or purchasing a Virtual Item through misclick or other mistake;


loss of progress or Virtual Items as a result of our decision to terminate a game or remove certain features or supporting services from a game;


loss or damage which is caused by us when such use does not comply with the Virtual Items Terms but which we and you could not anticipate nor expect to happen when you started using the Virtual Items;


any loss which is indirect or a side effect of the main loss or damage and which we and you could not anticipate nor expect to happen when you started using the Virtual Items, for instance if you lose revenue or salary, profit, opportunity or reputation; and


any loss or damage if the Virtual Items are not provided to you are interrupted or suspended or if we do not comply with the Virtual Items Terms because of events beyond our control, such as an act of God, accident, fire, lockout, strike or other official or unofficial labour dispute, civil commotion or other act or event beyond our reasonable control.




13. 
Who do I contact regarding purchases of Virtual Items in Facebook Messenger?


Purchases of Virtual Items made within Facebook's Messenger application are subject solely to Facebook's terms and conditions of purchase. Accordingly, we will be unable to help with your queries here which should be directed to Facebook.


C. Miniclip Subscription Terms and Conditions


1. 
When do these Subscription Terms and Conditions apply?


Some of our Services provide you with the opportunity to purchase a Subscription for access to fixed or dynamic content, premium content and/or Virtual Items on an ongoing basis. Subscriptions may be available at different fees and for different periods of time (the "Subscription Period") as specified in the Services at the point of purchase. These Subscription Terms and Conditions apply to all such purchases of Subscriptions.


2. 
What legal terms do I need to be aware of for Subscriptions?


Subscriptions are automatic regular payments that continue for the Subscription Period until cancelled.


Subscription fees are charged automatically on or before the beginning of each Subscription Period. Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon platform may place a temporary "authorisation hold" or "pending charge" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period). Please see the section below "Why has my payment card been charged before payment is due?" for further details.


A Subscription is automatically renewed at the end of each Subscription Period unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period
. If you do not cancel the Subscription at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period, the Subscription fees for the next Subscription Period will be taken during the 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period.


If a Subscription fee cannot be taken due to the absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reasons, the Subscription will not automatically end. The Subscription will automatically restart as soon as valid payment details are provided. Cancellation of a Subscription can only be done at your manual request. Please see the section below "How can I cancel a Subscription" for further details.


3. 
What is a trial period?


Some of our Subscriptions offer a trial period which is free of charge for a certain period of time that is specified in the Services. At the end of such trial period, the Subscription will automatically convert into a paid Subscription for the fees and for the Subscription Period set out in the Services at the time of activation of the trial period. If you do not cancel the Subscription within the trial period therefore, the first Subscription fee will be immediately and automatically charged when the trial period expires.


Please note that any paid Subscription begins immediately from the activation of such paid Subscription and not after the expiry of any trial period. Any unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a Subscription is activated prior to the expiry of such trial period.


Unless otherwise stated, each trial period offer may only be used once on an account. We are entitled to temporarily or permanently ban any account that abuse free trial periods (including, without limitation, any user activating multiple trial periods on the same account).


4. 
Can I cancel my order once I have bought a Subscription?


You cannot cancel your Subscription for the current Subscription Period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a Subscription. However, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out below.


5. 
How can I cancel a Subscription?


You can manage and cancel your subscriptions at any time in the Account Settings of your device. For iOS subscriptions, please see Apple's support page 
here
. For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play's support page 
here
. For Amazon subscriptions, please see Amazon's support page 
here
.


6. 
What happens when my Subscription ends?


You will immediately stop receiving any benefits such as "VIP access" that your Subscription provided including any regular free Virtual Items. You will also lose access to any Virtual Items that is only available for Subscribers.


7. 
Are Subscription fees refundable?


No. Except where required by law or at our sole discretion, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.


8. 
Can Subscription fees change?


We may modify the Subscription fee at our sole discretion and at any time. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the current Subscription period. You will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fee. If you disagree with the change in Subscription fee, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out in the section "How can I cancel a Subscription?".


9. 
Can Subscription content change?


Yes, we may modify the rewards and perks of each Subscription in our Services at our sole discretion.


10. 
Why do I still see advertising when I purchase a "remove ads" Subscription?


We use different types of advertising in our Services. When you purchase a Subscription that states that advertising is removed from a particular Service, it will not remove advertising that you choose to display. This includes rewarded video advertising which is only shown when you select the option to display it.


11. 
Why has my payment card been charged before payment is due?


All payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third-party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play. However, we understand that these platforms may place a temporary "authorisation hold" or "pending charge" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period). This is an action outside of Miniclip's control for the purposes of preventing credit card fraud but we understand no payment is actually taken from you until the 24 period prior to the commencement of a paid subscription period.


12. 
I have an issue with my Subscription. Who do I contact?


All payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third-party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon. If you have any payment related issues, then you need to contact such distributors directly. For any other issues, please contact us
