FEES AND BILLING; SUPPORT SERVICES
.



Orders
. Your order will be deemed accepted by us upon our making Solutions Available. Your receipt of an Order Form or delivery to us of a signed Order Form does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve all rights to decline any order, or require additional information before accepting an order and making Solutions Available.


Fees
. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Form, in exchange for Rightworks making Solutions Available, Fees applicable to those Solutions (including Fees for implementation) shall be billed in advance of the Billing Period, and any project-based Fees will be billed in arrears. You agree that the Fees are in exchange for making the Solutions Available and Customer shall pay the Fees even if the Solutions were not used during the Billing Period. For any Committed Term, you agree to pay applicable Fees for the entire Committed Term. If you terminate a Committed Term subscription at any time during a Committed Term for any reason, a lump sum payment (equal to 100% of the monthly unpaid Fee times the number of months remaining on the Committed Term) will be due immediately and charged to your preferred payment method.


Service Adjustments
. Fees will be prorated (“Prorated Fees”) for (i) new Solutions purchased and made Available or (ii) new Users added during a Billing Period. No amounts will be refunded with respect to cancellations or reductions of Solutions or Users during a Billing Period. License quantities for number of Users may be increased during a Committed Term, but only decreased to the extent the monthly license Fees for a Customer are not at any time less than 50% than the monthly Fees calculated at the highest number of Users subscribed to by the Customer during the Term.


Billing
. Rightworks will charge Customer on the first day of each Billing Period for (i) Prorated Fees for Solutions or Users added during the prior Billing Period, and (ii) Fees for Solutions purchased and active on your Account as of the first day of the Billing Period. Customer agrees to pay such amounts on the first day of each Billing Period.



Time is of the essence in all payment terms. Any amounts not paid when due shall accrue interest at a nominal rate of eighteen percent (18.0%) per annum, or the maximum rate permitted by law, if less, commencing with the payment due date.


Payment of Fees must be made by credit card (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and/or Discover) or bank (ACH) transfer or other method made available at Rightworks’ sole discretion. Rightworks reserves the right to restrict Customer’s use of credit cards in Rightworks’ sole discretion and require Customer to use ACH or another payment method.


In the event Customer chooses to pay by credit card or bank transfer, prior to activation of its Account and at any applicable time thereafter Customer authorizes Rightworks to charge the credit card provided by Customer or transfer funds from the bank account provided by Customer for the amount of the Fees.


All payments shall be made in United States Dollars (USD).


If the amounts payable for any Account you own or manage are past due in any Billing Period, in addition to Rightworks’ other remedies hereunder and in law and equity, you grant Rightworks the right to contact all Users associated with your Accounts for direct billing.






Discounts
. Rightworks may from time to time offer Discounts to Customers. These Discounts are conditioned upon a Customer’s and its Users’ compliance with the terms of the Agreement.



Upon a Customer’s or a User’s breach of any of the terms of the Agreement, Rightworks may, in its sole discretion and without notice, revoke any Discounts offered to such Customer.


Discounts are applicable only to the particular Solution specified as discounted in the Order Form or on the Web Portal. Discounts are effective only for the period specified on the Order Form or on the Web Portal.






Fee Adjustments
. The Fees shall be subject to price increases and decreases at any time by Rightworks in its sole discretion, provided that in each such case Rightworks shall notify the Account Owner of such adjustment no less than 30 days in advance of such adjustment.


Non-Refundable
. All Fees are non-refundable.


Support Services
. So long as Customer is not in default of its obligations under the Agreement, Rightworks will provide phone, chat and email support (the “Support Services”) in connection with the Solutions.


Taxes
. All amounts reflected on an Order Form are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT.  Customer is responsible for and shall pay all such taxes.  If the Customer is legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, the Customer must provide Rightworks with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for the relevant taxing jurisdiction(s).


Effect of Cancellation
. If you deliver a Customer Cancellation of a Solution offered on a Committed Term prior to the end of such Committed Term, a lump sum payment equal to the product of (i) the monthly amount for the terminated Solution and (ii) the number of unpaid months remaining in the Committed Term will become immediately due and payable and may be charged on any authorized payment method on file.


Automatic Renewals of Committed Terms
. Unless otherwise agreed to by Rightworks, Committed Terms set forth in Order Forms will automatically renew for additional Committed Terms of one (1) year unless either party gives notice to the other of non-renewal at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the relevant Committed Term.

Rightworks will use commercially reasonable efforts in each case to install and configure the Third-Party Products and Services on your Active Computers without causing unintended disruption and to troubleshoot any adverse interactions that may arise, however, Rightworks does not guarantee that any installation or configuration of any Third-Party Products and Services will be error free.


Rightworks reserves the right to change the Solutions or add, remove or modify any particular Third-Party Products and Services provided as part of the Solutions at any time, with or without notice to you.


Certain Third-Party Products and Services are specific to the Active Computer on which they are installed, and those products and services may not be transferred to another computer except in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. You agree that you shall (and shall cause your Users to) operate your Active Computers using reasonable judgment and will immediately contact Rightworks upon the discovery of any malicious content, malware, viruses, ransomware, or other suspected harmful intrusion.


Limitation of Liability
. You agree that neither Rightworks (including its Affiliates) nor its licensors shall have any liability or obligation with respect to any adverse consequences of installing or configuring the Third-Party Products and Services or any other software required in connection with Rightworks’ performance of the Solutions, except to the extent such liability arises as a direct result of such party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY.

These efforts include, but are not limited to, RDP encryption, username-based authentication, access control lists, user rights restriction, and other technical and administrative controls. Rightworks offers Multifactor Authentication (“
MFA
”) to all Customers of its Solutions. It is your responsibility to ensure your use (and your Users’ use) of the MFA feature. Rightworks shall have no liability for any harm or damages caused by your or your Users’ failure to use the MFA feature. You may, at your discretion, and within the technical limitations of the Solutions, encrypt or password-protect your Hosted Data.


Confidential Information
. Each party (“Recipient”) will be given access to Confidential Information from the other party (“Discloser”) to perform its obligations under this Agreement. A party’s Confidential Information shall not be deemed to include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly known other than through any act or omission of the Recipient; (b) was in the Recipient’s lawful possession before the disclosure; (c) is lawfully disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or, (d) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to, or reliance on, the Confidential Information of the Discloser, which independent development can be shown by written evidence. Rightworks’ Confidential Information includes the Solutions, product roadmaps, pricing, and the results of any performance tests of the Solutions. The terms of this Agreement are confidential to both parties. Each Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or a court order, provided that prior to any such disclosure, the Recipient will, to the extent legally permissible, provide to the Discloser notice of such request and use reasonable efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed is treated confidentially. Each Recipient will hold the Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and, unless required by law and disclosed pursuant to this Section, not make the Discloser’s Confidential Information available to any third party or use the Discloser’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than as set out in this Agreement.  The foregoing will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information three (3) years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement (or, with respect to trade secrets, once such Confidential Information no longer constitutes a trade secret under applicable law) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information, in whole or in part (i) to its employees, officers, directors, consultants and professional advisors (e.g., attorneys, auditors, financial advisors, accountants and other professional representatives, collectively, with the foregoing, “Representatives”) who have a need to know and are legally bound to keep such Confidential Information confidential by confidentiality obligations, or, in the case of professional advisors, are bound by ethical duties, to keep such Confidential Information confidential consistent with the terms of this Agreement.  Recipient is responsible and liable for its Representatives’ compliance with this Section, as if their actions or inactions were an action or inaction of Recipient.

General
.  Rightworks makes every reasonable effort to maintain operation of the Solutions.

Rightworks, at its sole discretion, may limit or deny access to its cloud infrastructure, if, in the judgment of Rightworks, such limitations or denials of access are required to assure the security of the network, the integrity of the network infrastructure, and/or to prevent damage to the network, the software, or the data stored on Rightworks servers. You acknowledge that the Solutions rely upon data communication media that are not under the control of Rightworks, and which are potentially vulnerable to data or security breaches, including, without limitation, networks used by your carriers, and the databases and servers controlled by your Internet providers. Rightworks shall not be liable for any such breaches.
