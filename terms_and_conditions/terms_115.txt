 EU law sets out some fairness and transparency requirements for contracts you sign
                     with consumers. 


 Which contract terms are concerned? 


 
The information below only concerns selling to consumers who buy outside their professional
                        sphere. It does not apply if you sell to other businesses.
 


 EU requirements apply to any contract term which has 
not
 been individually negotiated with the consumer, such as usual 
standard contract terms
 drafted in advance. Both the main subject-matter of your contract and the value-for-money
                     aspects are specifically excluded. 


 Take note that if you want to rely on the fact that the contract has been individually
                     negotiated, you will need to prove this. 


 Contracts must be fair 


 The standard contract terms used in the course of your business, whether they are
                     called 'terms and conditions' or are part of a detailed contract, have to be fair.
                     


 Under EU law, standard contract terms 
must not
: 




 be 
contrary to the requirement of good faith
; 


 
disadvantage consumers
 (in terms of rights & obligations), in relation to sellers/suppliers. 
 


 You must act in good faith, taking the consumers' legitimate interests into account,
                     by dealing fairly and equitably with them. 


 Unfair contract terms are not binding 


 If specific terms in a contract are unfair, they are not binding on consumers and
                     you may not rely on them, even if the consumer has signed the contract. 


 Provided the unfair term is not an essential element of the contract, the rest of
                     the contract (but not the unfair term) will continue to bind you and the consumer.
                     


 Contracts must be transparent 


 Contract terms must be drafted in plain, understandable language. Contract terms
                     must not only be grammatically clear but the consumer must be able to understand their
                     economic consequences. 






Warning


 Be aware that any ambiguities will be interpreted in the consumer's favour. 
 




 Examples of potentially unfair terms 


 Besides the general requirements of 'good faith' and 'balance', the EU rules contain
                     a list of specific contract terms that may be judged unfair. 


 Here are some situations where contract terms may be judged unfair under EU rules:
                     
 1. Liability when a consumer dies or is injured 


Open




Close






 Terms which exclude/limit your liability if a consumer dies or is injured because
                        of an act/omission on your part. 
 
 2. Compensation if you don't deliver 


Open




Close






 Terms which inappropriately exclude/limit consumers' rights to compensation if you
                        don't perform your side of the contract. 
 
 3. Get-out clause in your favour 


Open




Close






 Terms which allow you to get out of providing a service just because it doesn't suit
                        you, but which still bind the consumer. 
 
 4. One-sided compensation for cancellation 


Open




Close






 Terms which allow you to keep pre-payments if the consumer cancels the contract without
                        allowing for equivalent compensation to the consumer where you (the trader) cancel.
                        
 
 5. Excessive compensation 


Open




Close






 Terms which require a consumer who doesn't fulfil an obligation to pay an unreasonably
                        high amount of compensation. 
 
 6. One-sided cancellation 


Open




Close






 Terms which allow you to dissolve a contract unilaterally but where the consumer
                        does not enjoy the same right. 
 
 7. Cancellation at short notice 


Open




Close






 Terms which authorise you to terminate a contract with no fixed end-date at short
                        notice, except where absolutely justified. 
 
 8. Automatic extensions of fixed duration contracts 


Open




Close






 Terms whereby a consumer has to notify an intention to end the contract but where
                        the deadline for doing so is unreasonably early. 
 
 9. Hidden terms 


Open




Close






 Terms which bind consumers even though they could not have easily been aware of them
                        before signing the contract. 
 
 10. One-sided changes to the contract 


Open




Close






 Terms which allow you to alter a contract unilaterally unless the contract states
