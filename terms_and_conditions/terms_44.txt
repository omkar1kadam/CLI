BUSINESS FILINGS INCORPORATED
SERVICE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(last updated June 10, 2025)






IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, SINCE USING THIS WEBSITE AND THE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OF BUSINESS FILINGS INCORPORATED, OR PAYING THEREFOR, CREATES A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT.  NO CHANGES BY YOU TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  BUSINESS FILINGS INCORPORATED MAY CHANGE, ADD OR REMOVE ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME.  SUCH CHANGES SHALL BE POSTED ON THE APPLICABLE BIZFILINGS ONLINE PORTAL OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU.  IF ANY FUTURE CHANGES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE USING THE SERVICES.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES OR PAYMENT THEREFOR, NOW OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF A REVISED VERSION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WILL INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND OF ANY SUCH REVISED VERSION.


The provision of the 
Services
 (as defined below) by Business Filings Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“
BizFilings
”), is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.  You (“
Customer
”) (i) acknowledge that you have read and understand these terms and conditions, including any schedules, exhibits and other attachments hereto (collectively, this “
Agreement
”), (ii) agree to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement
 and (iii) agree to the terms and conditions of any future versions of this Agreement which are posted by BizFilings on the applicable online portal or otherwise made available to you.  This Agreement shall be effective as of the date Customer first uses the Services (the “
Effective Date
”). Customer and BizFilings are sometimes referred to herein individually as a “
Party
” or together as the “
Parties
”.


1. SERVICES AND FEES


1.1  
Provision and Use of the Services
. BizFilings itself or through one or more of its affiliates, subcontractors or other agents (“
BizFilings Parties
”) shall provide to Customer and its affiliates the services requested by Customer or a Customer User (as defined below) and described at www.bizfilings.com/service/service-descriptions.aspx and any other services requested by Customer or a Customer User and provided by BizFilings (collectively, the "
Services
"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  If Customer wishes to receive any additional services not described at www.bizfilings.com/service/service-descriptions.aspx, and BizFilings agrees to provide such services, BizFilings may require that the Parties describe such additional services, applicable fees and any required additional terms and conditions in a separate written agreement, upon the execution of which such services shall be included in the Services.  BizFilings shall be responsible for the performance of any BizFilings Parties.  Customer shall perform all Customer responsibilities and obligations set forth in this Agreement and shall be responsible for the performance of its affiliates, personnel, subcontractors, agents, advisors, representatives and other permitted third parties (“
Customer Users
”) and shall otherwise cooperate with BizFilings in connection with BizFilings’ provision of the Services.  Customer shall use the Services only for the internal business purposes of Customer and Customer Users and shall be responsible for (i) ensuring that each of its Customer Users receiving the Services complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) for any breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by any Customer User to the same extent as if such Customer User were “Customer” hereunder.  Customer Users shall not include any competitors of BizFilings, and Customer shall not permit any third party to use the Services or BizFilings Products in any way whatsoever without the prior written consent of BizFilings.  Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall not, and shall not permit any person or entity to, offer or use the Services for the benefit of any affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, including in any computer service business, service bureau arrangement, outsourcing or subscription service, time sharing or other participation arrangement.  Customer shall not use the Services in a manner contrary to or in violation of any applicable federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation.


1.2  
Customer Information and Instructions
. Customer acknowledges and agrees that performance of the Services shall be dependent on the timely completion of Customer’s responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement and that additional fees may apply with respect to any modifications to standard documents or processes made by Customer or at Customer’s request.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer will be responsible for (i) the accuracy and completeness and the compliance, sufficiency and effectiveness under applicable law of all data, documents, templates or other information provided to BizFilings or inputted into BizFilings’ system by Customer or Customer Users or on their behalf, or otherwise modified by them or at their request, and (ii) the consequences of any instructions given by Customer or any Customer User to BizFilings.


1.3  
Fees
. For Services performed by BizFilings or any BizFilings Party under this Agreement, Customer hereby agrees to pay BizFilings the applicable fees in accordance with BizFilings’ then current standard fee schedules for such Services (or as otherwise agreed by the Parties) and Section 5 below.  Customer will also be invoiced for all additional fees (if any) advanced by BizFilings on behalf of Customer or a Customer User including taxes, statutory filing and other fees, correspondent, courier messenger or delivery charges, and any other fees or charges advanced by BizFilings. Fees do not include pass-through or reimbursable expenses such as fees required by the relevant taxing jurisdiction, expedite fees, access fees, and taxes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute fees imposed on Customer by a government agency) (collectively, “Disbursements”). Disbursements are the responsibility of Customer and may include pass-through expenses, which are third-party charges incurred on behalf of, and at the direction of, Customer. BizFilings, acting solely as Customer’s restricted agent for the limited purpose of paying Disbursements, may pay such expenses on behalf of Customer, and Customer shall reimburse BizFilings for any such Disbursements so paid. In the event Customer seeks protection or commences any action under applicable bankruptcy laws, Customer shall be required to pre-pay all Disbursements. BizFilings reserves the right to modify the Fees from time to time.


2. THE TERM


The term of this Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and continue until terminated as set forth herein (the “
Term
”). For purpose of this Agreement, “
Annual Period
” shall mean each one year period running from the Effective Date to the next anniversary of such Effective Date.


3. TERMINATION


3.1  
Termination
. Either Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Service (i) if the other Party fails to perform any material obligation of this Agreement (including the payment of amounts owed hereunder) and such breaching Party fails to take good faith steps to cure such failure within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the other Party specifying such failure in reasonable detail or (ii) if the other Party seeks protection or commences any action under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar laws regarding insolvency or relief for debtor.  BizFilings may terminate this Agreement at any time if legally required or upon belief of Customer’s illegal or improper use of the Services.


3.2  
Termination for Convenience
. 


Either Party may terminate the Services or this Agreement at any time during the Term upon 180 days’ prior written notice to the other Party.


3.3  
Effect of Termination
. 


In the event of any such termination, (i) Customer will pay BizFilings for Services (a) provided under this Agreement to Customer up through the date of termination and (b) that BizFilings is legally required to provide to Customer following termination, (ii) with respect to Registered Agent Services, Customer will instruct and arrange for removal of BizFilings’ name as Customer’s Registered Agent in the applicable Secretary of States’ offices and pay all associated fees, and (iii) all rights (including any access and use rights and licenses) granted to Customer by BizFilings under this Agreement related to the terminated Services shall be terminated. For the avoidance of doubt and in light of BizFilings’ ongoing obligations under relevant state law to act as Registered Agent until the Customer designates a different Registered Agent and submits the appropriate forms to the Secretaries of State, BizFilings will continue to charge, and Customer will be obligated to pay, all fees that accrue until BizFilings’ name is removed as Registered Agent and/or so long as BizFilings is required by law in the applicable jurisdiction(s) to accept service of process on behalf of Customer.


4. TAXES


Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Customer shall pay all sales, consumer, use and similar taxes in connection with the Services (other than taxes on BizFilings’ net income).


5. STATEMENTS AND PAYMENT TERMS


For Annual Representation Services, BizFilings will submit to Customer a reasonably detailed invoice setting forth the number of Units for which Customer shall pay the Annual Representation Services fees for that Annual Period.  With respect to all other Services, BizFilings shall submit to Customer a reasonably detailed invoice which will set forth the Services used by, or provided to, Customer during the applicable period and the fees charged for such Services, consistent with the terms of this Agreement.  Customer agrees to pay BizFilings the applicable invoice amount within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice.  All such fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement shall be referred to herein as the “Fees.”  All amounts set forth in invoices not paid in full by Customer within 30 days (other than amounts in such invoices subject to a bona-fide good faith dispute) are subject to a late fee of 1.75% per month (or, if less, the maximum rate allowable by law) plus all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.  In the event of a bona fide good faith dispute as to an item on any such invoice, Customer shall promptly, but no later than fifteen (15) business days after receipt of such invoice, give written notice to BizFilings stating the details of any such dispute and shall promptly pay any undisputed amounts on such invoice.  The Parties shall work in good faith to promptly agree upon a resolution to any disputed items on such invoice.  BizFilings reserves the right to suspend access to and performance of the Services to any delinquent account without notice.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth, BizFilings reserves the right to modify the Fees from time to time. When completing a purchase with BizFilings online or via phone, we collect your credit card information and store certain details to enable order processing.  The information stored includes your credit card’s last four digits, expiration month and year, and the cardholder’s billing address.  By placing an order, you consent to BizFilings storing this information.  


6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS


6.1  
Confidential Information
. “
Confidential Information
” includes the terms of this Agreement and all trade secrets, processes, proprietary data, pricing, technology and product information, business and any other proprietary or confidential information provided by the disclosing Party to the receiving Party in connection with this Agreement, but excludes any information which: (a) is generally available to the public through no fault of the receiving Party or any of its affiliates or its or their directors, officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, or other agents (collectively,  a Party’s “
Representatives
”); (b) is or becomes available to the receiving Party through a source other than the disclosing Party or its Representatives that is not known or reasonably believed to have any legal, contractual or fiduciary duty of confidentiality; or (c) is or has been developed by the receiving Party independently of the disclosing Party or any of its Representatives and their respective Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer agrees and acknowledges that anonymized and de-identified data shall not be considered Customer’s Confidential Information and BizFilings shall be permitted to retain and utilize such anonymized and de-identified data.


6.2  
Treatment of Confidential Information
. Each Party covenants and agrees that it will keep and maintain all Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate and reasonable to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure, it will not disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to any third party, except with the disclosing Party’s prior written consent or if required by law or in response to a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process, and it will use and disclose Confidential Information of the other Party solely as necessary to implement or perform its obligations and duties pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BizFilings shall be permitted to disclose Customer’s Confidential Information to BizFilings’ Representatives involved in the provision of Services.  Under no circumstances may the receiving Party disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to a competitor of the disclosing Party.


6.3  
Injunctive Relief
. The Parties acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6 may cause irreparable injury to the disclosing Party and damages, which may be difficult to ascertain.  Therefore, the disclosing Party shall, upon such unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information, be entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief against the receiving Party.


7. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS


All intellectual property rights in the Services and products (including related tutorials and documentation) provided or made available to Customer or a Customer User by BizFilings as a part of the Services (including all improvements, enhancements, modifications or updates) (“
BizFilings Products
”) shall remain the exclusive, sole and absolute property of BizFilings or the third parties from whom BizFilings has obtained the right to use the BizFilings Products.  Intellectual property created by BizFilings pursuant to this Agreement shall be owned by BizFilings.  During the Term, Customer shall have a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to access and use the BizFilings Products (including any applicable BizFilings online portal) in connection with the Services solely as set forth in Section 1.1.  Customer shall at all times retain all intellectual property rights in all Customer data, proprietary information and materials provided by Customer to BizFilings in connection with the use and receipt of the Services.


8. WARRANTIES


Customer represents and warrants that (i) it has the requisite power, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement on behalf of itself, its affiliates and all other Customer Users and to perform the obligations required of it hereunder; (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have each been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action; (iii) it has or has obtained all necessary authority to order the Services provided by BizFilings; (iv) it has or has obtained all the necessary consents from any affected third parties to provide the information and documents to BizFilings in connection with the Services; and (v) all information, templates and documents provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Customer User to BizFilings hereunder, or otherwise modified by them or at their request, will comply in all respects with applicable law and the requirements of the applicable jurisdictions.

10. LIMITATION OF WARRANTY


10.1  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY HERETO SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, SAVINGS, BUSINESS OR DATA), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM OR ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER TORT, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY) AND EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES.


10.2  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, BIZFILINGS’ TOTAL AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF (I) $50,000 AND (II) AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO BIZFILINGS IN THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE UPON WHICH A CLAIM IS FIRST ASSERTED AGAINST BIZFILINGS BY CUSTOMER, IN EACH CASE LESS AGGREGATE DAMAGES PREVIOUSLY PAID BY BIZFILINGS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.


10.3  BizFilings is not an insurer with regard to the Services.  The fees for Services rendered, as well as the limitations of liability and remedy, are a reflection of the risks assumed by the parties.  Under no circumstances shall BizFilings, any BizFilings Party or any of its affiliates, suppliers, licensors, data providers, contractors or agents be liable for any loss of underlying collateral or loss (or decreased priority) of security interest in connection with the Services.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, BizFilings may assign this Agreement in whole or in part or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, upon written notice to Customer, to an affiliate of BizFilings; provided that any such assignment shall not release BizFilings from its obligations under this Agreement.

Each Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) any objection which it may now or later have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought in any court of the State of New York sitting in Manhattan; and (b) any claim that any action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  EACH PARTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES.

18. SEVERABILITY


If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision is to that extent deemed omitted, and the balance of this Agreement remains in full force if the essential terms and conditions of this Agreement for each Party remain valid, binding and enforceable.


19. AMENDMENTS


No amendment or modifications to this Agreement shall be valid or enforceable unless in writing executed by the authorized representatives of Customer and BizFilings.


20. WAIVER


A Party may not waive a right or remedy except pursuant to a writing executed by such Party.  No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy or requiring the satisfaction of any condition under this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the Parties, operates as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy or condition.  A waiver made in writing on one occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose that it is given and is not to be construed as a waiver on any future occasion.  The rights and remedies of the Parties set forth in this Agreement are not exclusive of, but are cumulative to, any rights or remedies now or subsequently existing at law, in equity or by statute.


21. FORCE MAJEURE


Neither Party shall be liable for failure or delay in performance of its obligations hereunder (other than Customer’s obligation to pay the Fees for Services provided) when such failures or delay is caused by events or causes beyond the control of such Party, including, without limitation, any of the following events, acts of God, extreme weather, natural calamities, labor strikes or unrest, terrorist attacks, government actions, power outages and disruptions in communication lines.


22. EXHIBITS


All exhibits, schedules, and attachments to this Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and made a part of this Agreement.


23. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES


The Parties intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create a right or cause of action in or on behalf of any person or entity, other than the Parties.


24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT


This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties in connection with the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties, including any confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement previously entered into between the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth in this Agreement.  In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any exhibit, schedule or attachment, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.  Neither Party shall be bound nor liable to the other Party for any representation, warranty, promise, covenant or understanding made by any agent, employee or other person that is not embodied in this Agreement.  Purchase orders, work orders or similar documents submitted to BizFilings by Customer will be for Customer’s internal administrative purposes only and the terms and conditions contained in any such purchase orders, work orders or similar documents will have no force and effect and will not amend or modify this Agreement.
