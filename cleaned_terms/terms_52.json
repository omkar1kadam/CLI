  "terms": "Okay, here’s a breakdown of the provided legal document, focusing on key takeaways and potential areas of interpretation.  This is a *draft* – a full legal review would be needed for finalization.\n\n**Document Title:** Data Security Addendum – Dartmouth College\n\n**Date:** May 5, 2025\n\n**Last Revised Date:** May 5, 2025\n\n**Division:** Finance & Administration – Division of Finance\n\n**Type:** Policy\n\n**Purpose:** This document updates the Data Security Addendum, strengthening requirements for protecting personal data and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.  It specifically addresses data breaches and data security breach remediation.\n\n**Key Changes & Highlights:**\n\n1. **Expanded Data Security Regulations:** The document elaborates on the FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) and other data protection laws (FERPA, Privacy, and potentially others) that apply to Dartmouth College. This is a significant change.\n\n2. **Data Security Breach Remediation Requirements:** The most important update: it now mandates a more detailed plan for addressing data breaches, including:\n   *   Immediate notification to students, faculty, staff, and relevant authorities.\n   *   Investigation of the breach.\n   *   Documentation of all actions taken.\n   *   Credit monitoring for affected individuals.\n   *   Ongoing monitoring and correction of vulnerabilities.\n\n3.  **Data Security Breach Notification:** Specific, detailed procedures are outlined for reporting a data breach, including required information.\n\n4.  **Data Security Requirements for Subcontractors:**  It now mandates strict requirements for data security practices for any permitted Subcontractors. This includes:\n   *   Compliance with the same data security standards as Dartmouth.\n   *   Secure data handling and access controls.\n   *   Data minimization (only collect the data necessary).\n   *   Regular security audits.\n\n5. **Data Security Policy Details:** The document details specific policies related to data security, including a statement of intent to comply with the required regulations.\n\n6. **Reimbursement for Data Security Breach Remediation:** The policy clarifies that the College will reimburse entities for data security breach remediation costs to the extent that the breach caused by the entity results in a data breach.\n\n**Important Considerations & Potential Interpretation:**\n\n* **Scope of Data:** The document’s scope appears to cover the broader realm of personal data, extending beyond just student records.  This underscores a heightened level of responsibility.\n* **\"Data Security Breach\":** The definition of a \"data security breach\" is crucial. It likely includes unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of personal data.\n* **Subcontractor Obligations:** The detailed requirements for subcontractors are a critical step in safeguarding data.\n* **Compliance with Regulations:** The document explicitly stresses the need for adherence to various privacy laws and regulations.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a legal professional. This is a preliminary analysis based on the provided text. This document requires thorough legal review to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.*\n\n**To help me provide more tailored assistance, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What is the primary goal of this document? (e.g., ensure compliance, strengthen data security, etc.)\n*   Are there any specific areas you’d like me to elaborate on or focus on?"
