Please be aware that Clarivate will:




Never ask for payment of any kind as part of our hiring or onboarding processes


Never ask an applicant to email sensitive personal information, such as a Social Security
                        Number, birthdate, credit card or bank account information
                    


Never issue pre-employment checks to purchase office supplies


Never ask you to pay up for an external course and upskill




If you have any question about a position posted in our company name, please check our current open

Federal Transparency In Coverage Rule








This link leads to the machine-readable files that are made available in response to the federal
                    Transparency in Coverage Rule and includes
                    negotiated service rates and out-of-network allowed amounts between health plans and healthcare
                    providers. The machine-readable files are
                    formatted to allow researchers, regulators, and application developers to more easily access and
                    analyze data.
