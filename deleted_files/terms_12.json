Can I include a clause that says, “We are not responsible for anything?”** “CAN I INCLUDE A CLAUSE THAT SAYS, ‘WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING?’” – Acknowledging the risk of liability is essential. *Focus:*  A disclaimer should be carefully worded and ideally, *consult an attorney* to ensure it's enforceable.\n* **C.
