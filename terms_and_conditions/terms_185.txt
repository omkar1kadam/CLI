General Terms

General Terms
. 


Product Specific Terms
: These include any additional terms that apply to your use of each of our product offerings, our consulting and other services, and third-party services.


Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
:
 This explains how we process your data and includes the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.


Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

12.1  Amendment; No Waiver. We may modify any part or all of the Agreement by posting a revised version at 
http://legal.hubspot.com
. The revised version will become effective and binding the next business day after it is posted. We will provide you notice of this revision by email or in-app notification. If you would like to receive an email notification when we update the Agreement, complete the form found at 
https://legal.hubspot.com/subscribe-tos-updates
. 


If you do not agree with a modification to the Agreement, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days after we send notice of the revision. If you give us this notice, then your subscription will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement prior to modification until your next renewal date, after which the terms posted at
 
http://legal.hubspot.com
 will apply
. 
However, if we can no longer reasonably provide the subscription to you under the terms prior to modification (for example, if the modifications are required by law or result from general product changes), then the Agreement and/or affected Subscription Services will terminate upon our notice to you and we will promptly refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Subscription Service after termination in accordance with the ‘Effect of Termination or Expiration’ provision of this Agreement. 


No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.


12.2  Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations of amounts due under this Agreement, neither party will be responsible for failure or delay of performance if caused by: an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; act of God; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage that is not caused by the obligated party; government restrictions; pandemic; or other event outside the reasonable control of the obligated party. Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event.


12.3  Actions Permitted. Except for actions for nonpayment or breach of a party’s proprietary rights, no action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.


12.4  Relationship of the Parties. You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between us.


12.5 Compliance with Laws. We will comply with all U.S. state and federal laws (where applicable) in our provision of the Subscription Service, the Consulting Services and our processing of Customer Data. We reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. 


We will comply with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which can be found on our 
Investor Relations
 page on 
hubspot.com
; the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is incorporated into this Agreement, and may be updated without additional notice to you. Any any other linked materials available on our Investor Relations Page are for information only and not incorporated into these terms, and you may subscribe to notifications about updates to the Investor Relations page separately. You will comply with all applicable laws in your use of the Subscription Service and Consulting Services, including any applicable export or trade laws. 


12.6  Severability. If any part of this Agreement or an Order Form is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in effect. The headings and section titles are provided for your convenience and ease of navigation only. 


12.7  Notices. To HubSpot: Notice will be sent to the contact address set forth in the 
Jurisdiction Specific Terms Appendix
, and will be deemed delivered as of the date of actual receipt.


To you: your address as provided in our HubSpot Subscription account information for you. We may give electronic notices by general notice via the Subscription Service and may give electronic notices specific to you by email to your e-mail address(es) on record in our account information for you or through the notifications center of the Subscription Service. We may give notice to you by telephone calls to the telephone numbers on record in our account information for you. You must keep all of your account information current.


12.8  Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the applicable Order), along with our 
Privacy Policy
 is the entire agreement between us for the Subscription Service and Consulting Services and supersedes all other proposals and agreements, whether electronic, oral or written, between us. We object to and reject any additional or different terms proposed by you, including those contained in your purchase order, acceptance, supplier portal, or website. Our obligations are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features of the Subscription Service or dependent on any oral or written comments made by us regarding future functionality or features of the Subscription Service. We might make versions of this Agreement available in languages other than English.  If we do, the English version of this Agreement will govern our relationship and the translated version is provided for convenience only and will not be interpreted to modify the English version of this Agreement.


12.9  Assignment. You will not assign or transfer this Agreement without our prior written consent, except that you may assign this Agreement to a successor by reason of merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of your assets, change of control or operation of law. We may assign this Agreement to any HubSpot Affiliate or in the event of merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, change of control or operation of law.


12.10  No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any third party person or entity any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.


12.11  Contract for Services. This Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar legislation as may be enacted, will not apply to this Agreement. If you are located outside of the territory of the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.


12.12  Authority. Each party represents and warrants to the other that it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that it is binding upon such party and enforceable in accordance with its terms. You further warrant and represent that you have the authority to procure your Affiliates compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

APPENDIX 


U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMER ADDITIONAL TERMS


If you are a U.S. local, state or federal government entity, including public institutions of higher education, that uses the HubSpot Subscription Services (a “Government Customer”), then these HubSpot Government Customer Additional Terms apply. We may update or change these terms in the same way as we can our Agreement as we describe in the ‘Amendment; No Waiver’ section of our 
General Terms
. 


These terms apply to the extent required by applicable law.  

1. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMER PURPOSE


Government Customer may only use the Subscription Service and Consulting Services for a governmental-related purpose.  These terms will not apply in the event the Subscription Service and/or Consulting Services are used for any private, personal, or non-governmental-related purpose.


2.  INDEMNIFICATION


Government Customer's obligations in the ‘Indemnification’ section of the 
General Terms 
will only apply to the extent permitted by applicable law. 


3.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


The 'Limitation of Liability' sub-section in the ‘Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability’ section of the 
General Terms
 applies to the extent permitted by applicable law. The following sentence is also added to the end of the 'Limitation of Liability' sub-section in the ‘Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability’ section of the 
General Terms
 if applicable: “ALSO PROVIDED HOWEVER, THIS LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY TO EITHER PARTIES’ LIABILITY ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE THAT RESULTS IN BODILY INJURY, DEATH, OR DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE PROPERTY.”


4.  CONTRACTING ENTITY AND APPLICABLE LAW


The ‘Contracting Entity, Applicable Law, Additional Terms’ section of the 'Governing Law and Jurisdiction' section of the General Terms is revised to read as follows:


You are contracting with HubSpot, Inc. and this Agreement is governed by the laws applicable to you as a Government Customer, or if no such laws are specified, then the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without reference to conflicts of law principles. Government Customer agrees that we have standing and privity of contract to bring a claim directly against Government Customer in a court or body of competent jurisdiction.
