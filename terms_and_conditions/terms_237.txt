terms & conditions
TERMS OF USE
Effective Date: November 15, 2024
Version 2
Please read the following Terms & Conditions carefully as they affect your legal rights. These Terms & Conditions contain an arbitration agreement that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes rather than jury or any other court proceedings, or class actions of any kind. The arbitration agreement is set forth in Section 19 below.
 
1. USE OF THE SITE
These Terms & Conditions (the “
Terms
”) govern your use of the Circle K Inner Circle mobile application (the “
App
”), the website 
https://www.circlek.com/inner-circle
 and other digital properties owned and operated by Circle K Stores Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “
Circle K
”, the “
Company
”, “
we
”, “
us
” or “
our
”) in the United States where these Terms are posted (collectively, the “
Site
”). These Terms also govern your enrollment and participation in the Inner Circle Loyalty Program (the “
Program
”, collectively referred to with the Site herein as the “
Service
”). These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you, as a user of the Service, and us, as the provider of the Service. Your access to and use of the Service requires your compliance with these Terms. By downloading, accessing and/or using any portion of the Site and/or enrolling or participating in the Program, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge and consent to our data practices described in our

2. AMENDMENTS TO THE TERMS; ADDITIONAL TERMS
It is your responsibility to review the posted Terms and any applicable Additional Terms (defined below) each time you use the Service. Each time you sign in to or otherwise access or use the Service you are entering into a new agreement with us on the then applicable Terms and you agree that we may notify you of new Terms by posting them on the Service (or in any other reasonable manner of notice which we elect), and that your use of the Service after such notice constitutes your going forward agreement to the new Terms for your new use and transactions.
 
In some instances, additional or different terms, posted on the Service, apply to your use of certain parts of the Service (individually and collectively “
Additional Terms
”). To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise. References to “Terms” herein shall include reference to any applicable Additional Terms.

LOCATION-BASED FEATURES
If GPS, geo-location or other location-based features are enabled on your Device, you acknowledge that your device location may be tracked and may be shared with others consistent with our Privacy Policy.

You can terminate device location tracking via a mobile app by us by uninstalling the application. Territory geo-filtering maybe required in connection with use of some Service features due, for instance, to Content territory restrictions. The location-based services offered in connection with Company’s mobile app(s) or feature(s) are for individual use only and should not be used or relied on in any situation in which the failure or inaccuracy of use of the location-based services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or physical or property damage.

By using or accessing such program, you agree to be bound by any of Google’s applicable terms of use or service.

19. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

Dispute
”) shall be in Phoenix, Arizona. Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Phoenix, Arizona for any and all purposes.
Pre-Arbitration Notification
. The Company and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that the Company need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (“
IP Disputes
,” with all other disputes referred to as “
General Disputes
”). The party making a claim – whether you or the Company – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If the Company is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in the Company account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 19.B. If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 1130 W Warner Rd., Tempe, AZ 85284 USA (Attn: General Counsel). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 19. Either you or the Company, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to Section 19.D) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.
Arbitration of Claims
. All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any Dispute, or the scope of the provisions of this Section, shall be submitted to JAMS (
www.jamsadr.com
) for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in Phoenix, Arizona, before a single arbitrator. If the matter in dispute is between the Company and a consumer, the matter shall be submitted to JAMS in accordance with its Policy on Consumer Arbitration Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS. We may have the right to pay the JAMS fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. If you are a consumer you have the right to in-person hearing. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The parties may engage in the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Phoenix, Arizona or, if sought by the Company, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Maricopa County Superior Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.
Limitation on Injunctive Relief
. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER GENERATED CONTENT “

Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 19 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
Class Action Waiver
. As permitted by applicable law, both you and the Company waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 19 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.
Jury Waiver
. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF. 
Small Claims Matters
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 19.F.
 
The provisions of Section 19 shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties. Section 19 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.
 
20. SEVERABILITY; INTERPRETATION
If any provision of these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity and enforceability of any of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms. To the extent provided by applicable law, you agree to waive and will waive any applicable statutory and common law principles that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.
