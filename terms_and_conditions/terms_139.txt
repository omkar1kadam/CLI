Key Takeaways


Website terms of use can be legally binding if users receive proper notice and provide affirmative consent.


Clickwrap agreements are the strongest form of enforcement, while browsewrap agreements face enforceability challenges.


Unilateral modification clauses and poor placement of terms can void enforceability.


Courts consider the clarity, accessibility, and presentation of terms when determining if they're binding.


Specific clauses such as arbitration, data usage, and content ownership are often enforceable but may be contested.


Are website terms and conditions legally binding? Yes, if they meet the elements that create a legally binding contract and how the terms are presented to the user for review and acceptance on the website.
Terms of Service are the terms and conditions users consent to before using or purchasing goods or services on a website. When the user agrees to the Terms of Service, a contract is created between the user and company. For the contract to be legally binding, the presentation and acceptance must meet approved standards.
Two approaches that can be taken by website owners to present the Terms of Service properly include:


Browsewrap agreements- These display a notice on the website that if the user proceeds to use the website, they agree to the terms and conditions. Browsewrap agreements do not include a button the user must press to move forward.


Clickwrap agreements- These require the user to click to accept the terms and conditions before using the website. This type of legal agreement uses an agree button or similar phrasing.


Determining if Terms of Service Are Enforceable
Setting up enforceable Terms of Service requires specific placement, explanations and proper record keeping including:


Proper and obvious notification to users that the Terms of Service exist.


Legal agreements should not be buried in the website footer. Courts have found this to be insufficient, and the terms are not considered legally binding.




Clickwraps
 that are too simple are not enforceable. The user must receive an obvious notification that the Terms of Service exist and use of the website confirms the user agrees to these terms. The user must click a button or check a box. This action helps confirm the user's agreement of the terms.


Browsewraps may be easier for the user to use the website, proving acceptance is harder due to lack of an action like clicking a button or checking a box.


Tracking Terms of Service agreements can be difficult as it must be continually updated to reflect updated versions, dates and acceptance data.


If the Terms of Service agreement includes a unilateral provision which states the company can change the agreement without notifying the customers, the agreement is entirely unenforceable. There have been many cases involving large corporations that have confirmed that unilateral provisions are not enforceable including Blockbuster Inc, Talk America, Inc., and Safeway Inc. Any changes to the terms must be relayed to the customer to be legal. A grace period may be included in the terms to let customers know changes may be made. In 2012, Zappos had their entire terms of service voided by the court because it used a browsewrap agreement, that does not require the user to click or check to accept and because a unilateral provision was part of the terms.
Legal Requirements for Enforceable Website Terms
To ensure website terms of use are legally binding, courts generally require that certain legal conditions be met. These include:




Notice and Accessibility
: Users must be made aware that the terms exist and must be able to access them before agreeing. This is a fundamental element of contract formation.




Affirmative Consent
: Enforceability is strongest when the user has provided affirmative consent, such as clicking an “I agree” button. This form of clickwrap is more legally robust than implied consent through use (browsewrap).




Clear and Understandable Language
: The terms must be presented in a way that is clear and understandable to a reasonable user. Overly complex or hidden language may render clauses unenforceable.




Opportunity to Review
: Users must have a reasonable opportunity to review the terms. Courts are more likely to enforce terms when users are not rushed or misled.




Proper Version Control
: It's important to track when terms are updated and ensure users are notified and re-consent if changes occur.


Terms of Service Clauses
Users should note that the terms included may not be in their best interest. This includes:


Arbitration clauses that stipulate any legal issues must be settled through arbitration companies. Arbitration companies are privately run and rule in favor of corporations. An attempt was made to limit arbitration clauses by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but was not approved by the Senate.


Clauses that give companies the ability to collect, store, and share the personal data of the user. This results in data breaches from companies who do not have the proper security in place to protect sensitive data. This has increased the need for identity theft protection.


Personal data terms attempt to give the company ownership of your content. Instagram included a provision that allowed them to sell the users photos for advertisements without notification or payment to the user. While the clause was legally allowed, Instagram pulled the clause due to intense public outrage.


Terms of Service are enforceable in civil and criminal court. Under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) accessing a computer without proper authorization or in a way that exceeds authorization is a federal crime. The CFAA is vague and has been used to prove federal law violations, not just violations of the Terms of Service agreements. In 2013, Aaron Swartz was prosecuted by the federal government for copying files from JSTOR, a digital academic library. Although Swartz violated the terms, JSTOR did not press any charges. This has put CFAA under scrutiny.
Examples of Valid and Invalid Terms of Use
Understanding how courts interpret and enforce website terms of use is crucial. Here are illustrative examples:
Valid:


A shopping platform uses a clickwrap agreement that requires users to click “I agree” before completing checkout. The terms are clearly visible and include a last updated date.


A SaaS provider emails users notifying them of updated terms and requires re-consent before continued use of services.


Invalid:


A streaming site includes a unilateral modification clause allowing terms to change without notice. Courts have ruled such clauses unenforceable unless notice and re-acceptance are provided.


A mobile app’s terms are only linked in small print at the bottom of the home screen without requiring user acknowledgment. Courts may deem this insufficient notice.


Common Pitfalls That Undermine Enforceability
Even well-written terms of use can be rendered unenforceable if they fall into common legal traps. These include:




Unilateral Modification Clauses
: Courts disfavor provisions that allow companies to change the terms without notice to users. Unless users are explicitly informed and given the option to accept new terms, these clauses are often unenforceable.




Inconspicuous Placement
: Terms buried in footers or hidden behind vague hyperlinks may not hold up in court. Clear and conspicuous presentation is essential.




Lack of Affirmative Action
: If users aren’t required to take an action—like clicking “Agree”—to accept the terms, it’s harder to prove they intended to be bound.




Overly Broad or Unfair Clauses
: Courts may strike down terms that are deemed unconscionable, such as overly one-sided indemnity clauses or broad waivers of liability.


Frequently Asked Questions




Are terms of use legally binding if users don't click 'I agree'?
Not always. Without affirmative consent, it’s harder to prove users agreed to the terms, making enforcement less likely.




Can companies change their terms of use without notifying users?
Generally, no. Courts require users to be notified and often to re-consent to modified terms.




Is a link to the terms in a website footer sufficient?
Usually not. Courts have found that burying terms in footers may not provide sufficient notice for enforceability.




Do terms of use need to be written in plain language?
Yes. Clear and accessible language improves enforceability by ensuring users understand what they’re agreeing to.




What’s the best way to make terms of use legally enforceable?
Use clickwrap agreements with clear notice, require affirmative consent, and keep records of user acceptance.
