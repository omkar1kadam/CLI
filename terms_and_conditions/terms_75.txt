  General Terms and Conditions
  




Regardless of which Qualtrics Cloud Services, professional services or research
services you purchase, there is one set of foundational terms for them all - the General
Terms and Conditions, which we call the 
GTCs
.
This means you don’t have to spend time reviewing different terms every time
you make a new purchase. The GTCs will apply to all of your contracts with Qualtrics.


 




























TermScout


We are not the only ones who think our terms are fair to our customers. Our GTCs have been reviewed and certified as ‘Customer Favorable’ by TermScout, an independent contract rating company.

Translated General Terms and Conditions
