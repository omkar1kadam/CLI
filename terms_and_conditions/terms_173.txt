Terms & Conditions for Services
Subject to the express terms of any other valid agreement you (“
Client
”) have with Trimble (as defined below), Trimble’s provision of Services (as defined below) are governed by these Terms and Conditions for Services (“
Terms
”). 
“Trimble”
 
means Trimble Inc. and/or its affiliates identified in the SOW (as defined below). Any contrary or additional terms or conditions appearing on Client orders or associated purchase documentation will be of no effect. 
Trimble agrees to furnish the Services only upon these Terms. These Terms include the terms and conditions of any orders, quotations, statements of work, scopes of work, or other similar document for the provision of services by Trimble that references these Terms and is accepted by Trimble in writing (collectively referred to herein as the "
Scope of Work
” or “
SOW
”). Each accepted SOW will be interpreted as a single set of Terms, independent of other orders and/or SOWs.
Trimble quotations are non-binding unless otherwise expressly stipulated in writing. Quotes are accepted as valid and binding only when confirmed by Trimble in writing. Accepted quotations cannot be canceled for any reason without the prior written consent of Trimble.
1. Services.
 Trimble agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to render the Services described in the SOW (the “
Services
”) by the delivery dates specified therein, if any. Any deliverables provided to Client as part of the Services will be deemed “
Deliverables
.” The parties may execute additional SOWs describing Services and referencing these Terms.
2. Changes to Scope of Services.
 If Client desires changes to a SOW, Client will submit a written request to Trimble detailing the proposed changes. Upon receipt of Client’s request, or if Trimble desires changes to an SOW, Trimble shall prepare an amendment to the SOW, change order, or like document (referred to herein collectively as the 
“Change Document”
) detailing the changes, any fee adjustments required as a result of such changes, any adjustments to the delivery schedule required as a result of such changes, and any other necessary adjustments. If the Change Document is mutually agreed to, both parties will execute it. If Client and Trimble are not able to agree to the terms of the Change Document, the SOW will remain unchanged.
3. Payment.
 Unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW, the following shall apply. Client will pay Trimble its customary rates for Services monthly based upon actual time spent. Client agrees to reimburse Trimble for pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred in the course of performing the Services at any location other than Trimble’s site. Trimble will invoice Client for expenses incurred and at Client’s request and expense Trimble will provide copies of receipts for which charges are incurred. All payments are non-refundable and shall be made in U.S. dollars (or such other currency specified in a SOW) within thirty (30) days from the date of Trimble’s invoice. Client will be responsible for all sales, service, and value added taxes, withholdings, duties and levies in connection with the Services (excluding taxes based on the net income or profits of Trimble or any franchise tax imposed on Trimble). Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.
4. Termination.
Either party may terminate these Terms or any SOW if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of these Terms within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such part (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). Following termination, Sections 5 (License and Ownership), 7 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 8 (Confidential Information), 9 (Client Reference), 10 (Export Compliance) and 11 (General Provisions) will survive. Section 3 (Payment Terms) will survive with respect to payments earned prior to termination.
5. License and Ownership
5.1Client Materials
. Client agrees to provide Trimble with reasonable access to and a limited right to use Client technical data, computer programs, files, documentation, and/or other materials (“
Client Materials
”), resources, personnel, equipment or facilities to the extent such access is necessary for the performance of Services. Client will be responsible for, and assumes the risk of any problems resulting from the content, accuracy, completeness, competence or consistency of Client Materials or its personnel. To the extent that Client does not timely provide the access, quality, level of detail and/or scope required for Trimble to perform the Services or deliver the Deliverables, Trimble shall be excused from performance until such items/access are provided or the applicable deficiencies corrected. Client owns and will retain ownership (including all intellectual property rights) in the Client Materials. Client grants to Trimble a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to access and use the Client Materials (including through subcontractors) as required for Trimble’s performance of the Services.
5.2. Deliverables.
 Subject to Section 5.3 (Assignment of Ownership to Client), Trimble hereby grants Client a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, or develop derivative works of the Deliverables but only for internal purposes and otherwise in accordance with the description of Client’s use and any restrictions set forth below or in the applicable SOW. Trimble owns and will retain ownership (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Deliverables (excluding any Client Materials) and any modifications, improvements and derivative works thereof (including any such materials to the extent incorporating any ideas, feedback or suggestions of Client (“
Feedback
”)). Client acknowledges that Trimble is free to exploit, use, license and distribute, any Feedback provided to Trimble as it sees fit, without obligation of compensation or attribution.
5.3Assignment of Ownership to Client
. If the parties have agreed that Trimble will assign ownership of any portion of the Deliverables to Client, the relevant SOW must expressly set forth the terms and conditions regarding such assignment.
5.4Trimble Product Enhancements and Modifications.
 Notwithstanding anything in these Terms or any SOW to the contrary, any enhancements or other modifications to any of Trimble’s commercially available products and/or services that are developed by Trimble as part of the Services shall be owned by Trimble and Client shall have no right, title, or interest therein; provided, that if Trimble has granted to Client a license or access to use such commercially available products and/or services  under a written agreement, then Client’s rights under such agreement shall also extend and apply to any enhancements and modifications so made by Trimble. Other than Client Materials, Trimble owns all computer programs, utilities and intellectual property which aid Trimble in performing the Services or which are produced as a result of the Services.
5.5Other Agreements
. Trimble and Client may have entered into one or more separate agreements under which Trimble supplies, licenses, or otherwise makes available certain products and/or services to Client, including updates and enhancements to that software. The delivery and use of any such products and/or services is governed by the terms of such other agreement and not these Terms, and even if listed in a SOW such products and/or services shall not be considered a Deliverable hereunder.
6. Limited Warranty and Disclaimer.
6.1 
Trimble will perform the Services and deliver the Deliverables in a professional and workmanlike manner and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Trimble will, as its sole liability and obligation to Client for failure to provide Services or Deliverables meeting this warranty, (a) re-perform the non-conforming Services or (b) re-deliver the non-conforming Deliverables at no additional cost to Client if notified of the non-conformity within thirty (30) days of delivery of the applicable Service or Deliverable, or if Trimble determines such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable period of time, (c) terminate the applicable Statement of Work and refund the portion of fees attributable to such non-conforming Services or Deliverables. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, TRIMBLE DOES NOT MAKE ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ARISING BY STATUTE, CUSTOM, COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES. TRIMBLE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
6.2 Construction Model. 
If the Deliverables include a "
Construction Model
," which is a 3D representation of a construction project including, but not limited to, some or all of the following elements: building components, construction equipment, and site components, Client agrees and acknowledges that any Construction Model is developed for the sole use of Client and based on specifications provided by the Client (the “Specifications”). Client will be responsible for, and assumes the risk of, any problems resulting from the content, accuracy, or completeness of the Specifications. The Construction Model will not be used for any project other than as specified by the Statement of Work. If the Construction Model is being used by Client as part of an effort to generate construction documents, as-built construction drawings, or “shop” drawings, Trimble accepts no liability and/or responsibility for such construction documents, as-built construction drawings, or shop drawings. Any use of, or reliance on, a Construction Model by any third party will be at their sole risk and without liability to Trimble. If Client discloses the Construction Model to any third party, Client shall to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Trimble for any suit, claim, action, damage or liability brought against Trimble by any third party arising from the Specifications, construction documents, as-built drawings, shop drawings, or the development, delivery or use of all or any part of the Construction Model by Client or by any such third party. Trimble makes no representations regarding the Construction Model’s compliance with applicable building and construction codes or regulations. The Construction Model does not constitute an approved construction document, as-built drawing or shop drawing. Client will consult with its local building authority to confirm adherence with applicable building codes or regulations. Before beginning construction,  Client will have a licensed architect or trade-appropriate engineer sign off on the Construction Model and all construction documents, drawings, Specifications and/or models.
7. Limitation of Remedies and Damages.
NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. IN NO EVENT WILL TRIMBLE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED THE NET AMOUNT TRIMBLE HAS ACTUALLY RECEIVED FROM CLIENT UNDER THE SOW APPLICABLE TO SUCH CLAIM. THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT APPLY TO EITHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ITS BREACH UNDER SECTION 8 (CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION) OR TO CLIENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM ARISING AS A RESULT OF CLIENT’S VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO THE DELIVERABLES UNDER SECTION 5.2 (DELIVERABLES), OR ITS INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 6.2 AND 10. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 7 WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
8. Confidential Information.
8.1Confidential Information. 
Each party (“
Receiving Party
”) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (“
Disclosing Party
”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“
Confidential Information
”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any software, documentation or technical information provided by Trimble (or its agents) and these Terms and any   Quotations, and SOWs will be deemed Confidential Information of Trimble without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
8.2 Exclusions.
 The Receiving Party’s nondisclosure obligation will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (a) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (b) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (d) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (e) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).
8.3 Use and Protection of Confidential Information. 
The Receiving Party may use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only in pursuance of its business relationship with the Disclosing Party under these Terms. Except as expressly provided hereunder, the Receiving Party will not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to anyone without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent. The Receiving Party will take all reasonable measures to avoid disclosure, dissemination or unauthorized use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, including, at a minimum, those measures it takes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. The Receiving Party will restrict the possession, knowledge and use of the Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, legal and financial advisors who (i) have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the parties’ business relationship, and (ii) have executed written nondisclosure agreements obligating them to protect the Confidential Information. 
8.4 Legally Required Disclosure.
 The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent reasonably required to comply with court, administrative, or binding orders of governmental entities, provided that the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party of the receipt of the order and cooperates fully in any effort to obtain an order preserving the confidential nature of the Confidential Information.
9. Client Reference.
 Client agrees that upon execution of these Terms, Trimble may add Client to Trimble’s publicly disclosed customer list (which may include use of Client’s name and logo in customer lists on Trimble’s website and marketing materials). Except as set forth in this Section 9, neither party may use the other party’s name in advertisements nor otherwise publicly disclose the terms and content of these Terms without the other’s prior written consent.
10. Export Compliance. 
Client is responsible for complying with all applicable export and import regulations and obtaining all necessary export and import licenses or permits for the direct or indirect export or import of any Deliverable. Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that Trimble technology, software, products, and/or proprietary information that may be used in the creation of Deliverables and incorporated therein are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and were exported from the United States, if at all, in accordance with those regulations. Therefore, Client shall comply strictly with all U.S. export control laws and regulations applicable to the Deliverables, and shall not export, re-export, transfer, divert or disclose any such Deliverables, or any direct product thereof, to any destination restricted or prohibited by U.S. export control laws, or to any national or resident thereof. Client will defend, indemnify and hold Trimble harmless against any liability (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of Client’s failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph. Client’s failure to comply with any term of this paragraph will constitute a material breach hereof and entitle Trimble to immediately terminate these Terms and any associated SOW in addition to any other remedy available at law or equity. Client’s obligations under this paragraph will survive the termination of these Terms or any SOW.
11. General Provisions
11.1 Governing Law.
 Unless expressly otherwise set forth in an SOW, these Terms and any dispute, claim or controversy arising therefrom shall be governed by the laws of the applicable location set forth below, unless expressly prohibited by local law, in each case without reference to “conflict of laws” principles:
If Client is domiciled in: United States
Governing Law: California and applicable United States federal law
Courts having exclusive jurisdiction: Federal and California state courts located in Santa Clara County, CA
If Client is domiciled in: Rest of World
Governing Law: The Netherlands
Courts having exclusive jurisdiction: Courts located in the Netherlands
Any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be commenced in such jurisdiction, and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. No dispute or legal action arising under these Terms may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after such cause of action accrued, except that an action for nonpayment may be brought within two (2) years of the date of the applicable invoice.
11.2 Independent Contractors.
 Each party is an independent contractor of the other and neither is an employee, agent, partner or joint venturer of the other. Neither party shall voluntarily or involuntarily bind nor attempt to bind the other to any contract or to the performance of any obligation. Neither party may represent to third parties that it has any right to enter into any obligation on the other’s behalf. The parties hereby agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of these Terms.
11.3 Assignment; Binding Effect. 
Neither party shall assign these Terms without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Trimble may assign these Terms to an affiliate or in the event of a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of Trimble’s assets or voting securities. These Terms will otherwise be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.
11.4 Notices.
 Any notice, report, approval or consent which may be or is required to be given under these Terms shall be in writing to the address(es) specified in the SOW, and shall be deemed to have been received: (a) when delivered personally, (b) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) one (1) day after having been sent by a commercial overnight carrier with written verification of receipt. Either Party may change its notice address by written notice to the other. In addition, any notice to Trimble shall also include a copy to: Trimble Inc., Attention: General Counsel, Important Legal Notice, 935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA.
11.5 Force Majeure. 
Except for payment obligations, neither Party will be liable to the other for failure to perform its obligations to the extent caused by an event beyond the reasonable control of such Party, including, without limitation, government regulations or orders, outbreak of a state of emergency, acts of god, acts of terrorism, blockade, war, warlike hostilities, civil commotion, riots, epidemics, fire, natural disasters, strikes, lockouts, failure or diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of approval or a license by a government agency, or any other similar cause or causes, provided that, to the extent feasible, the affected party promptly notifies the other of such occurrence and makes its commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate the effect thereof.
11.6 Waivers
. Any waiver by either party of any breach of these Terms, whether express or implied, will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No provision of these Terms will be waived by any act, omission or knowledge of a party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly authorized officer of the waiving party. If any provision of these Terms is adjudicated by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
11.7 Headings.
 The headings contained in these Terms are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.
11.8 Entire Agreement.
 No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Client will supersede these Terms, and any such document relating to these Terms shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. Both parties agree that these Terms, together with the SOW, are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties, and supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
11.9 Official Language
. The official language of these Terms is English. If there is a conflict between versions of these Terms in any other language, the English language version controls.
11.10 Amendments.
 No waiver, modification, or addition to these Terms, or any assignment of Client’s rights or obligations under an SOW shall be valid or binding on Trimble unless in writing and signed by an authorized Trimble representative.
11.11 Independent Activities.
 Client acknowledges that nothing in these Terms will prohibit Trimble or from providing products and services that are similar to or compete with the Services and Deliverables provided that Trimble does not violate any of its confidentiality obligations under these Terms in connection with such activities.
11.12 Order of Precedence. 
In case of any inconsistency, conflict, or ambiguity among these Terms, an SOW, or any related agreements, the documents shall govern in the following order: (a) these Terms; (b) mutually executed Change Documents to an SOW; (c) the SOW; and (d) other documents expressly referenced in a Change Document and/or the SOW. Among categories of documents having the same order of precedence, the term or provision that includes the latest date shall control. Information identified in one document and not identified in another shall not be considered a conflict or inconsistency.
11.3 Counterparts.
 The SOW may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be considered an original and all of which when taken together will constitute a single fully-signed original. Facsimile and other electronic means of signatures on the SOW are binding.
[End of Terms]
Servicebedingungen
Vorbehaltlich und nach Maßgabe der ausdrücklichen Bestimmungen einer jeglichen sonstigen gültigen Vereinbarung, die Sie (“
Kunde
”) mit Trimble haben, unterliegt die Erbringung der Dienstleistungen durch Trimble diesen Servicebedingungen (“
Bedingungen
”). 
“Trimble” 
bedeutet in diesen Servicebedingungen Trimble Inc. oder das in der Leistungsbeschreibung identifizierte verbundene Unternehmen. Allen Geschäftsbedingungen des Kunden wird hiermit widersprochen und diese werden deshalb nicht Bestandteil des Vertrags.
Trimble verpflichtet sich, die Dienstleistungen nur entsprechend diesen Bedingungen zu liefern. Sie werden in alle Dokumente wie Bestellungen, Angebote oder Leistungsbeschreibungen einbezogen und sind die Grundlage für die Erbringung der Dienstleistungen durch Trimble (gemeinsam hier als "
Leistungsbeschreibung
” oder “
SOW
” bezeichnet). Jede angenommene Leistungsbeschreibung stellt einen eigenen Vertrag dar, der in der Regel unabhängig von anderen Leistungsbeschreibungen zu sehen ist.
Trimbles Angebote sind unverbindlich, es sei denn sie werden schriftlich als verbindlich bezeichnet. Aufträge, die sich auf unverbindliche Angebote beziehen, müssen von Trimble schriftlich bestätigt werden. Nach unserer Bestätigung können die Vereinbarungen nur mit unserer Zustimmung storniert werden.
1. Dienstleistungen. 
Trimble unternimmt es, die in der Leistungsbeschreibung beschriebenen Dienstleistungen (“
Dienstleistungen
”) zu den vereinbarten Terminen zu erbringen. Ergebnisse der Dienstleistungen werden im Weiteren als solche bezeichnet. Die Parteien können zusätzliche Leistungsbeschreibungen vereinbaren, wobei diese Bedingungen stets Vertragsbestandteil werden.
2. Änderungen des Leistungsumfangs. 
Falls der Kunde Änderungen an einer Leistungsbeschreibung wünscht, wird er Trimble eine schriftliche Aufforderung übermitteln, die die vorgeschlagenen Änderungen detailliert angibt. Nach Erhalt der Aufforderung des Kunden oder wenn Trimble Änderungen an einem Leistungsverzeichnis wünscht, erstellt Trimble einen Zusatz zur Leistungsbeschreibung, einen Änderungsauftrag oder ein ähnliches Dokument (jeweils ein 
“Änderungsdokument”
), das die Änderungen, jegliche aufgrund jener Änderungen notwendigen Anpassungen der Vergütung und des Zeitplans und jegliche sonstigen notwendigen Anpassungen im Detail aufführt. Sobald das Änderungsdokument beiderseitig angenommen wird, werden beide Parteien es anwenden. Falls der Kunde und Trimble sich nicht auf die Konditionen des Änderungsdokuments einigen können, findet die Leistungsbeschreibung ohne Änderung Anwendung.
3. Zahlung. 
Wenn in der Leistungsbeschreibung nichts anderes bestimmt ist, gilt Folgendes: Der Kunde wird Trimble monatlich Trimbles übliche Sätze für Dienstleistungen auf der Basis der tatsächlich aufgewendeten Zeit bezahlen. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, Trimble die vorab genehmigten Kosten für Reisen, Unterbringung und Mahlzeiten zu erstatten, die bei der Erbringung der Dienstleistungen an einem anderen Standort als dem von Trimble anfallen. Trimble wird dem Kunden die angefallenen Kosten in Rechnung stellen, und auf Anfrage und Kosten des Kunden wird Trimble Kopien der Belege über die angefallenen Kosten übergeben. Alle Zahlungen sind nicht erstattungsfähig und müssen in EURO (oder einer anderen in einem Arbeitsumfang vorgegebenen Währung) innerhalb von dreißig (30) Tagen nach dem Datum von Trimbles Rechnung erfolgen. Der Kunde trägt die Verantwortung für alle Verkaufs-, Dienstleistungs- und Umsatzsteuern, -abzügen, Abgaben und Gebühren in Verbindung mit den Dienstleistungen (mit Ausnahme von Steuern auf der Basis des Jahresüberschusses von Trimble oder einer jeglichen Trimble auferlegten Körperschaftssteuer). Zahlungsverzögerung führt zur Berechnung eines Verzugszinses in Höhe von 1,5 Prozent pro Monat, ermittelt auf Grundlage des fälligen Betrages, bzw. des gesetzlichen Verzugszinses; es kommt der niedrigere der beiden Zinssätze zum Einsatz.
4. Beendigung.
Eine Partei kann einen oder mehrere Einzelverträge außerordentlich kündigen, falls die andere Partei (a) einer erheblichen Vertragspflichtverletzung nicht innerhalb von dreißig (30) Tagen nach einer schriftlichen Mahnung abhilft; (b) den Geschäftsbetrieb ohne Nachfolger einstellt; oder (c) Gegenstand eines Insolvenzverfahrens oder einer Zwangsverwaltung wird oder ein solches Verfahren gegen die Partei eingeleitet (und nicht binnen sechzig (60) Tagen aufgehoben) wird. Nach der Beendigung bleiben die Abschnitte 5 (Lizenz und Eigentum), 7 (Begrenzung der Rechtsmittel und Schadenersatz), 8 (Vertrauliche Informationen), 9 (Kundenreferenz), 10 (Einhaltung der Exportbestimmungen) und 11 (Allgemeine Bestimmungen) weiterhin gültig. Abschnitt 3 (Zahlungsbedingungen) bleibt in Bezug auf Zahlungen gültig, die vor der Beendigung verdient wurden.
5. Lizenz und Eigentum
5.1 Material des Kunden
. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, Trimble einen angemessenen Zugang zu den technischen Daten des Kunden, Computerprogramme(n), Dateien, Dokumentation und/oder sonstige(n) Material (“
Material des Kunden
”) einzuräumen und deren Nutzung für Zwecke der Vertragserfüllung zu gestatten, des weiteren Ressourcen, Mitarbeiter, Ausrüstungen oder Einrichtungen zur Verfügung zu stellen, soweit dies für die Erbringung der Dienstleistungen erforderlich ist. Der Kunde trägt die Verantwortung für jegliche Probleme, die sich aus dem Inhalt, der Richtigkeit, Vollständigkeit, Kompetenz oder Konsistenz des Materials des Kunden oder mangels Beistellung seiner Mitarbeiter ergeben. Solange der Kunde den Zugang, die Qualität, Detailgenauigkeit und/oder den Inhalt, den Trimble für die Erbringung der Dienstleistungen benötigt, nicht liefert, ist Trimble von der Erfüllung befreit, bis jene(r) Dinge/Zugang bereitgestellt werden oder die jeweiligen Mängel korrigiert sind. Der Kunde hat und behält das Eigentum (einschließlich aller geistigen Eigentumsrechte) am Material des Kunden. Der Kunde gewährt Trimble eine gebührenfreie, nicht-exklusive Lizenz zur Nutzung des Materials des Kunden (einschließlich durch Subunternehmer) zur Erbringung der vertragsgegenständlichen Dienstleistungen.
5.2. Ergebnisse. 
Vorbehaltlich und nach Maßgabe von Abschnitt 5.3 (Abtretung des Eigentums an den Kunden) gewährt Trimble hiermit dem Kunden eine zeitlich unbegrenzte, weltweite, gebührenfreie, nicht-exklusive Lizenz, die Ergebnisse zu nutzen, zu kopieren, zu verändern oder Bearbeitungen anzufertigen, jedoch ausschließlich für interne Zwecke, im Einklang mit der Leistungsbeschreibung und vorbehaltlich der nachfolgend oder in der jeweiligen Leistungsbeschreibung aufgeführten Einschränkungen. Trimble behält sich die Eigentumsrechte an den Ergebnissen vor (mit Ausnahme jeglichen Materials des Kunden) und jeglichen Änderungen, Verbesserungen und Bearbeitungen derselben (einschließlich aller Ergebnisse und Teile davon, die Ideen, Feedback oder Vorschläge des Kunden enthalten (“
Feedback
”)). Der Kunde erkennt an, dass Trimble Feedback in freiem Ermessen verwerten, nutzen, lizenzieren und vertreiben kann und zwar ohne Verpflichtung zu Entschädigung oder Nennung der Urheberschaft.
5.3 Abtretung des Eigentums an den Kunden
. Falls die Parteien vereinbart haben, dass Trimble Rechte an Ergebnissen oder Teile davon an den Kunden abtreten wird, muss die entsprechende Leistungsbeschreibung ausdrücklich die Konditionen dieser Abtretung darlegen.
5.4 Produktverbesserungen und Änderungen durch Trimble. 
Ungeachtet anderslautender Aussagen in diesen Bedingungen oder jeglicher Leistungsbeschreibung wird Trimble Eigentümer jeglicher Verbesserungen oder sonstigen Änderungen seiner im Markt verfügbaren Produkte und Dienstleistungen, die Trimble im Rahmen der Dienstleistungserbringung einbezieht oder anpasst und der Kunde erwirbt kein Recht, Eigentum oder Lizenz daran; wobei die Verbesserung oder sonstige Änderung in den Umfang einer erteilten Lizenz oder Nutzungsgestattung betreffend der vom Kunden erworbenen oder lizenzierten Produkte und Dienstleistungen einbezogen wird. Abgesehen vom Material des Kunden stehen Trimble die Rechte an allen Computerprogrammen, Anwendungen und geistigem Eigentum, die Trimble bei der Erbringung der Dienstleistungen helfen oder als Folge der Dienstleistungen produziert werden, zu.
5.5 Sonstige Vereinbarungen
. Trimble und der Kunde haben evtl. eine oder mehrere weitere Vereinbarungen abgeschlossen, nach der/denen Trimble bestimmte Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen an den Kunden liefert, lizenziert oder ihm anderweitig zur Verfügung stellt, einschließlich Aktualisierungen und Verbesserungen von Software. Die Lieferung und Nutzung jeglicher derartiger Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen unterliegen den Konditionen jener anderen Vereinbarung und nicht diesen Bedingungen, und solche Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen dürfen, selbst wenn sie in einem Arbeitsumfang aufgeführt sind, nicht als Ergebnis gemäß diesen Bedingungen betrachtet werden.
6. Beschränkte Garantie und Haftungsausschluss.
6.1 
Trimble wird die Dienstleistungen und die Ergebnisse sorgfältig und fachmännisch und weitestgehend im Einklang mit allen einschlägigen Gesetzen, Verordnungen und Normen erbringen. Falls Trimble die Dienstleistungen oder Ergebnisse nicht vertragskonform erbringt, beschränken sich die Ansprüche des Kunden wie folgt: Trimble wird (a) die mangelhaften Dienstleistungen erneut erbringen oder (b) die mangelhaften Ergebnisse erneut zur Verfügung stellen, und zwar ohne zusätzliche Kosten für den Kunden, falls es innerhalb von dreißig (30) Tagen nach Lieferung der entsprechenden Dienstleistung oder Ergebnisses über einen Mangel benachrichtigt wird, oder, falls Trimble meint, dass eine solche Wiedervornahme innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist wirtschaftlich nicht möglich ist, (c) die jeweilige Leistungsbeschreibung beenden und den Anteil der Vergütung, der auf die mangelhaften Dienstleistungen oder Ergebnisse entfällt, erstatten. MIT AUSNAHME DER OBIGEN VERPFLICHTUNG ÜBERNIMMT TRIMBLE KEINE WEITEREN ZUSICHERUNGEN, GARANTIEN ODER BEDINGUNGEN, UND ES BESTEHEN WEDER MÜNDLICHE NOCH SCHRIFTLICHE NEBENABREDEN; DIE VERTRAGLICHE BESCHAFFENHEIT IST IN DIESEN BEDINGUNGEN ABSCHLIESSEND VEREINBART, DISPONIERBARE GESETZLICHE REGELUNGEN UND HANDELSBRÄUCHE FINDEN KEINE ANWENDUNG. TRIMBLE ÜBERNIMMT AUSDRÜCKLICH KEINERLEI IMPLIZITE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGEN FÜR DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT, ZUFRIEDENSTELLENDE QUALITÄT, EIGNUNG FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK UND NICHTVERLETZUNG VON RECHTEN.
6.2 Bauwerksdatenmodell. 
Falls die Ergebnisse ein "
Datenmodell
" umfassen, also eine 3D-Darstellung eines Bauprojekts, einschließlich u. a. einiger oder aller der folgenden Elemente: Baukomponenten, Bauausrüstung und Standortkomponenten, dann akzeptiert und bestätigt der Kunde, dass jedes  Datenmodell für die alleinige Nutzung durch den Kunden und auf der Basis der vom Kunden vorgegebenen Spezifikationen (die „Spezifikationen“) entwickelt wird. Der Kunde wird für jegliche Probleme verantwortlich sein, die sich aus dem Inhalt, der fehlenden Richtigkeit oder Vollständigkeit der Spezifikationen ergeben, und das entsprechende Risiko tragen. Das Datenmodell wird nur für das in der Leistungsbeschreibung angegebene Projekt und kein anderes verwendet. Falls das Datenmodell vom Kunden bei der Erstellung von Bauzeichnungen, Baubestandsplänen oder Ausführungsplänen verwendet wird, akzeptiert Trimble keine Haftung und/oder Verantwortung für diese Bauzeichnungen, Baubestandspläne oder Ausführungspläne. Falls Dritte ein Datenmodell nutzen oder sich darauf verlassen, geschieht dies ausschließlich auf Risiko des Kunden und ohne Haftung seitens Trimble. Der Kunde stellt Trimble im gesetzlich zulässigen Rahmen schad- und klaglos gegenüber Forderungen, Klagen, Schaden oder Haftung, die/der von Dritten gegen Trimble geltend gemacht werden, und darauf beruhen, dass das Datenmodell einem Dritten offengelegt wird oder sich aus den Spezifikationen, Bauzeichnungen, Baubestandsplänen oder Ausführungsplänen oder der Weiterentwicklungen oder der Nutzung des ganzen Datenmodells oder eines Teils desselben durch den Kunden oder irgendeinen derartigen Dritten ergibt. Trimble übernimmt keine Haftung bezüglich der Einhaltung geltender Bau- und Planungsgesetze oder -vorschriften. Das Konstruktionsmodell stellt keine genehmigte Bauzeichnung, Baubestandsplan oder Ausführungsplan dar. Der Kunde wird seine lokalen Baubehörden konsultieren, um zu bestätigen, dass die geltenden Baugesetze oder -vorschriften eingehalten werden.

8.1 Vertrauliche Informationen. 
Jede der Parteien (“
Empfänger
”) akzeptiert, dass alle(s) Codes, Erfindungen, Know-how, Geschäfts-, technische und finanzielle Informationen, die sie vom Offenlegenden (“
Offenlegender
”) erhält, vertrauliches Eigentum des Offenlegenden darstellt (“
Vertrauliche Informationen
”), vorausgesetzt, sie sind bei der Offenlegung als vertraulich identifiziert oder sollten aufgrund der Art der offengelegten Informationen und der Umstände der Offenlegung vom Empfänger vernünftigerweise als Vertrauliche Informationen erkannt werden. Jegliche von Trimble (oder seinen Bevollmächtigten) bereitgestellte(n) Software, Dokumentation oder technischen Informationen, diese Bedingungen, jegliche Preisangebote und die Arbeitsumfänge gelten auch ohne jegliche Kennzeichnung oder weitere Identifizierung als Vertrauliche Informationen von Trimble. Außer wie in dieser Vereinbarung ausdrücklich autorisiert, muss der Empfänger Vertrauliche Informationen vertraulich halten und ist nicht berechtigt, sie zu nutzen oder offenzulegen. Der Empfänger erkennt an, dass die Offenlegung Vertraulicher Informationen einen beträchtlichen Schaden verursachen würde, der nicht allein durch die Zahlung von Schadenersatz getilgt werden kann, so dass der Offenlegende nach einer solchen Offenlegung durch den Empfänger berechtigt ist, angemessene Wiedergutmachung über die ihm gesetzlich zustehenden Rechte hinaus zu verlangen.
8.2 Ausschlüsse. 
Die Geheimhaltungsverpflichtung des Empfängers gilt für keine Informationen, von denen der Empfänger dokumentieren kann, dass: (a) sie vor Erhalt der Vertraulichen Informationen rechtmäßig in seinem Besitz oder ihm bekannt waren; (b) sie ohne Verschulden des Empfängers öffentlich bekannt sind oder wurden; (c) der Empfänger sie von einem Dritten ohne Verletzung irgendeiner Vertraulichkeitsverpflichtung rechtmäßig erhalten hat; (d) sie von Mitarbeitern des Empfängers, die keinen Zugang zu jenen Informationen hatten, unabhängig entwickelt wurden; oder (e) sie infolge einer Vorschrift, eines Gesetzes oder einer gerichtlichen Anordnung offengelegt werden müssen (allerdings nur in dem minimalen Ausmaß, das erforderlich ist, um jene Vorschrift oder Anordnung zu erfüllen, und dann mit Vorabmitteilung an den Offenlegenden).
8.3 Nutzung und Schutz Vertraulicher Informationen. 
Der Empfänger darf die Vertraulichen Informationen des Offenlegenden nur zur Fortsetzung seiner Geschäftsbeziehung mit dem Offenlegenden entsprechend diesen Bedingungen nutzen. Außer wie hierin ausdrücklich bestimmt, wird der Empfänger die Vertraulichen Informationen des Offenlegenden niemandem ohne die vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung des Offenlegenden offenlegen. Der Empfänger wird alle angemessenen Maßnahmen ergreifen, um eine Offenlegung, Weitergabe oder unbefugte Nutzung der Vertraulichen Informationen des Offenlegenden zu verhindern, einschließlich zumindest jener Maßnahmen, die er trifft, um seine eigenen Vertraulichen Informationen ähnlicher Art zu schützen. Der Empfänger wird den Besitz, die Kenntnis und Nutzung der Vertraulichen Informationen auf seine Mitarbeiter, Auftragnehmer, Rechts- und Finanzberater beschränken, die (i) diese Vertraulichen Informationen in Verbindung mit der Geschäftsbeziehung der Parteien kennen müssen und (ii) schriftliche Geheimhaltungsvereinbarungen unterzeichnet haben, die sie verpflichten, die Vertraulichen Informationen zu schützen. 
8.4 Gesetzlich erforderliche Offenlegung. 
Der Empfänger darf Vertrauliche Informationen in dem Ausmaß offenlegen, in dem dies vernünftigerweise notwendig ist, um richterliche oder behördliche Anordnungen oder verbindliche Anordnungen staatlicher Stellen zu erfüllen, vorausgesetzt, dass der Empfänger den Offenlegenden über den Erhalt der Anordnung unverzüglich informiert und vollständig dabei kooperiert, eine Anordnung zur Wahrung der Vertraulichkeit der Vertraulichen Informationen zu erwirken.
9. Kundenreferenz. 
Der Kunde stimmt zu, dass nach Vertragsschluss Trimble den Kunden zu der veröffentlichten Kundenliste von Trimble (evtl. einschließlich der Nutzung des Namens und des Logos des Kunden in Kundenlisten auf der Website und in Marketingmaterial von Trimble) hinzufügen darf. Außer wie in diesem Abschnitt 9 bestimmt, darf keine der Parteien ohne die vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung der anderen Partei den Namen der anderen Partei in jeglicher Werbung verwenden oder die Konditionen und den Inhalt dieser Bedingungen veröffentlichen.
10. Ausfuhrvorschriften. 
Der Kunde ist dafür verantwortlich, alle geltenden Export- und Importvorschriften zu erfüllen und alle notwendigen Export- und Importlizenzen oder -genehmigungen für die direkte oder indirekte Aus- oder Einfuhr eines jeglichen Ergebnisses einzuholen. Der Kunde bestätigt und akzeptiert hiermit, dass Technologie, Software, Produkte und/oder geschützte Informationen von Trimble, die bei der Erzeugung von Ergebnissen evtl. verwendet werden und in diese einfließen, den US-Exportverwaltungsvorschriften unterliegen und, wenn überhaupt, im Einklang mit jenen Vorschriften aus den USA exportiert wurden. Daher muss der Kunde alle für die Ergebnisse geltenden Gesetze und Vorschriften der US-Exportkontrolle streng erfüllen und darf keine derartigen Ergebnisse oder irgendein direktes Produkt derselben an irgendeinen Zielort, der laut den US-Exportkontrollgesetzen unzulässig ist, oder einen jegliche Staatsbürger desselben oder eine dort ansässige Person exportieren, wiederausführen, übertragen, umleiten oder offenlegen. Der Kunde wird Trimble verteidigen, entschädigen und schadlos halten gegen/für/von eine(r) jegliche(n) Haftung (einschließlich Anwaltsgebühren), die sich aus einer Verletzung der Konditionen dieses Abschnitts durch den Kunden ergeben. Die Verletzung irgendeiner Klausel dieses Absatzes durch den Kunden gilt als materielle Verletzung dieses Vertrages und berechtigt Trimble, zusätzlich zu jeglichen nach Gesetz oder Billigkeit verfügbaren Rechtsmitteln, diese Bedingungen und einen jeglichen zugehörigen Arbeitsumfang fristlos zu kündigen. Die Verpflichtungen des Kunden aus diesem Absatz bleiben auch nach der Beendigung dieser Bedingungen oder eines jeglichen Arbeitsumfangs weiterhin gültig.

11.5 Höhere Gewalt.

[Ende der Bedingungen]
Conditions générales des Services
Sous réserve des stipulations expresses de tout autre accord valide existant entre vous (le « 
Client
 ») et Trimble (défini ci-après), la fourniture des Services (définis ci-après) par Trimble est régie par les présentes Conditions générales des Services (les « 
Conditions
 »). 
« Trimble » 
désigne Trimble Inc. et/ou ses sociétés affiliées identifiées dans l'EDP (défini ci-après). Toute condition ou modalité contraire ou complémentaire figurant sur les commandes du Client ou sur des documents d'achat associés sera sans effet.
Trimble convient de fournir les Services uniquement selon les présentes Conditions. Les présentes Conditions incluent les conditions générales de tous les devis, commandes, cahiers des charges, descriptifs de prestations ou autre document similaire concernant la fourniture de services par Trimble qui fait référence aux présentes Conditions et est accepté par Trimble par écrit (collectivement dénommés ci-après « 
Énoncé des prestations
 » ou « 
EDP
 »). Chaque EDP accepté sera interprété comme un ensemble unique de Conditions, indépendant d'autres commandes et/ou EDP.
Les devis de Trimble n’impliquent aucun engagement sauf stipulation écrite expresse contraire. Les devis ne sont reconnus comme étant valides et exécutoires que sur confirmation écrite de Trimble. Les devis acceptés ne peuvent être annulés sous aucun motif sans le consentement écrit préalable de Trimble.
1. Services. 
Trimble convient de déployer des efforts commerciaux raisonnables pour fournir les Services décrits dans l’EDP (les « 
Services
 ») aux dates indiquées, le cas échéant, dans ce dernier. Tous les éléments à livrer au Client dans le cadre des Services sont considérés comme des « 
Délivrables
 ». Les parties peuvent établir des EDP additionnels décrivant les Services et faisant référence aux présentes Conditions.
2. Modification de la portée des Services. 
Si le Client souhaite modifier un EDP, il doit soumettre à Trimble une demande écrite décrivant en détail les changements proposés. À réception de la demande du Client ou si Trimble souhaite modifier un EDP, Trimble prépare un amendement pour l’EDP, une commande rectificative ou un document semblable (ci-après désignés collectivement le 
« Document de modification »
) précisant les changements, les éventuels ajustements de frais et de délais de livraison induits par ces changements et tout autre ajustement nécessaire. Si le Document de modification est mutuellement accepté par les parties, celles-ci s'appliqueront. Si le Client et Trimble ne parviennent pas à tomber d’accord sur les modalités du Document de modification, l’EDP restera inchangé.
3. Paiement. 
Sauf mention contraire figurant dans l’EDP applicable, les dispositions suivantes s’appliquent. Le Client paie mensuellement à Trimble ses tarifs habituels pour les Services en fonction du temps réel passé. Le Client convient de rembourser à Trimble les frais préalablement approuvés de repas, d'hébergement et de déplacement encourus lors de l'exécution des Services sur tout site autre que celui de Trimble. Trimble facture au Client les dépenses encourues et, à la demande et à la charge du Client, Trimble fournira des copies des factures correspondant à ces dépenses. Tout paiement est non remboursable et est effectué en dollars américains (ou toute autre devise indiquée dans un EDP) dans les trente (30) jours à compter de la facturation par Trimble. Le Client est redevable de toutes les taxes sur les ventes, les services et la valeur ajoutée, retenues à la source, droits de douane et impositions en lien avec les Services (à l'exclusion des taxes basées sur le revenu net ou les bénéfices de Trimble ou de tout droit de franchise imposé à Trimble). Tous les règlements effectués en retard seront soumis à des frais de service équivalents à 1,5 % par mois de la somme due ou au montant maximum autorisé par la loi, le mois élevé des deux étant retenu.
4. Résiliation.
L'une ou l'autre partie peut mettre fin aux présentes Conditions ou à tout EDP si l'autre partie : (a) manque de remédier à toute violation substantielle des présentes Conditions dans un délai de trente (30) jours suivant la réception d'une notification écrite signifiant ladite violation ; (b) cesse toute exploitation sans successeur en affaires ; ou (c) se place sous la protection de toute faillite, redressement, acte de fiducie, entente ou concordat ou procédure comparable conclu avec des créanciers, ou si une quelconque procédure du genre est instituée à l'encontre de ladite partie (et n'aboutit pas à un non-lieu dans un délai de soixante (60) jours). Suite à la résiliation, les paragraphes 5 (Licence et droit de propriété), 7 (Limitation des recours et des dommages-intérêts), 8 (Informations confidentielles), 9 (Référence au Client), 10 (Conformité à l'exportation) et 11 (Dispositions générales) resteront en vigueur. Le paragraphe 3 (Paiement) continuera de s’appliquer pour les paiements reçus avant la résiliation.
5. Licence et droit de propriété
5.1 Matériel du Client
. Le Client accepte de donner à Trimble un accès raisonnable à et un droit restreint d'utilisation sur ses données techniques, programmes informatiques, fichiers, documents et/ou autres éléments (« 
Matériel du Client
 »), ressources, employés, équipements ou installations dans la mesure où cet accès est nécessaire à l’exécution des Services. Le Client est responsable du contenu, de l’exactitude, de l'exhaustivité, de la compétence ou de la cohérence du Matériel du Client ou de son personnel et assume les risques de problèmes qui y sont liés. Dans la mesure où le Client ne fournit pas en temps voulu l’accès, la qualité, le degré de détail et/ou la marge de manœuvre nécessaires à Trimble pour assurer les Services ou remettre les Délivrables, Trimble sera dispensé d'intervention jusqu'à ce que ces éléments/cet accès soient obtenus ou que les défaillances en question soient corrigées. Le Client détient et conserve la propriété (dont l'ensemble des droits de propriété intellectuelle) sur le Matériel du Client. Le Client accorde à Trimble une licence gratuite non exclusive afin d’accéder au et d'utiliser le Matériel du Client (y compris par l’intermédiaire de sous-traitants) pour les besoins de l’exécution des Services par Trimble.
5,2. Délivrables. 
Sous réserve du paragraphe 5.3 (Cession du droit de propriété au Client), Trimble octroie au Client par les présentes une licence perpétuelle, internationale, gratuite et non exclusive pour utiliser, copier, modifier ou développer des travaux dérivés des Délivrables, mais uniquement à des fins internes et par ailleurs conformément à la description de l’utilisation faite par le Client et à toute restriction spécifiée ci-après ou dans l’EDP applicable. Trimble détient et conserve la propriété (dont l'ensemble des droits de propriété intellectuelle) sur les Délivrables (à l’exclusion de tout élément du Matériel du Client) et sur les modifications, améliorations et travaux dérivés de ceux-ci (y compris les éléments qui incluent des idées, remarques ou suggestions du Client (les « 
Contributions
 »)). Le Client reconnaît que Trimble est libre d’exploiter, d’utiliser, de concéder sous licence et de distribuer toute Contribution soumise à Trimble comme il lui paraît opportun, sans obligation de dédommagement ou d’attribution.
5.3 Cession du droit de propriété au Client
. Si les parties ont convenu que Trimble cèderait la propriété de toute fraction des Délivrables au Client, l’EDP correspondant doit expressément énoncer les conditions générales relatives à cette cession.
5.4 Amélioration et modification des produits de Trimble. 
En dépit de toute disposition contraire figurant dans les présentes Conditions ou dans tout EDP, les améliorations ou autres modifications apportées à tout produit et/ou service de Trimble disponibles sur le marché que Trimble développe dans le cadre des Services sont la propriété de Trimble et le Client n’y a aucun droit, titre ou intérêt ; étant entendu que si Trimble a concédé au Client une licence ou un accès à ces produits et/ou services disponibles sur le marché dans le cadre d’un accord écrit, alors les droits du Client en vertu dudit accord s'étendront et s'appliqueront également aux améliorations et modifications ainsi effectuées par Trimble. Outre le Matériel du Client, Trimble détient l’ensemble des programmes informatiques, des utilitaires et des éléments de propriété intellectuelle aidant Trimble à exécuter les Services ou nés des Services.
5.5 Autres accords
. Trimble et le Client peuvent avoir conclu un ou plusieurs accords distincts en vertu desquels Trimble fournit, octroie sous licence ou met de toute autre façon à la disposition du Client certains produits et/ou services, dont des mises à jour et des améliorations de ce logiciel. La fourniture et l’utilisation de ces produits et/ou services sont régies par les modalités de ces autres accords et non par les présentes Conditions ; même s’ils figurent dans un EDP, ces produits et/ou services ne sont pas considérés comme des Délivrables dans le cadre des présentes.
6. Garantie limitée et renonciation.
6.1 
Trimble exécute les Services et livre les Délivrables de façon soignée et professionnelle et, à tous égards importants, conformément à l’ensemble des lois, règles et réglementations applicables. Si les Services ou Délivrables fournis ne respectent pas cette garantie, Trimble a pour seule responsabilité et obligation envers le Client (a) d’exécuter à nouveau les Services non conformes ou (b) de livrer à nouveau les Délivrables non conformes sans frais supplémentaires pour le Client si la non-conformité lui est notifiée dans les trente (30) jours suivant la fourniture du Service ou Délivrable concerné ou, si Trimble estime que ces actions correctives sont impossibles dans un délai raisonnable, (c) de résilier l’Énoncé des prestations en vigueur et de rembourser la partie des frais correspondant à ces Services ou Délivrables non conformes. À L'EXCEPTION DE LA GARANTIE LIMITÉE PRÉCITÉE, TRIMBLE NE FORMULE AUCUNE AUTRE DÉCLARATION, GARANTIE OU CONDITION, QUELLE QUE SOIT SA NATURE, ÉCRITE OU VERBALE, EXPRESSE OU TACITE OU DÉCOULANT D’UNE LOI, D’UNE COUTUME, D’UNE PRATIQUE HABITUELLE OU D’UN USAGE COMMERCIAL, À L’ÉGARD DES SERVICES ET DÉLIVRABLES. TRIMBLE EXCLUT SPÉCIFIQUEMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION IMPLICITE DE VALEUR MARCHANDE, DE QUALITÉ SATISFAISANTE, D'ADÉQUATION À UNE UTILISATION PARTICULIÈRE ET DE NON-VIOLATION DE DROITS.
6.2 Modèle de construction. 
Si les Délivrables incluent un « 
Modèle de construction
 », qui est une représentation 3D d'un projet de construction incluant, mais sans s’y limiter, certains ou la totalité des éléments suivants : composants de bâtiment, équipements de construction et composants de site, le Client reconnaît que tout Modèle de construction est développé à l’usage exclusif du Client et est basé sur les spécifications transmises par le Client (les « Spécifications »). Le Client est responsable du contenu, de l’exactitude ou de l'exhaustivité des Spécifications et assume les risques de problèmes qui y sont liés. Le Modèle de construction ne sera utilisé pour aucun autre projet que celui spécifié dans l’Énoncé des prestations.. Si le Modèle de construction est utilisé par le Client dans le cadre de l’élaboration de documents de construction, de plans de récolement ou de plans d'atelier, Trimble rejette toute responsabilité et/ou obligation vis-à-vis de ces documents de construction, plans de récolement ou plans d'atelier. Toute utilisation de ou référence à un Modèle de construction par un tiers est à ses propres risques, sans que la responsabilité de Trimble ne soit engagée. Si le Client divulgue le Modèle de construction à un tiers, le Client, dans toute la mesure permise par la loi, défendra, indemnisera et garantira Trimble contre tous procès, plaintes, actions en justice, actions en dommages-intérêts ou procédures de responsabilité intentés contre Trimble par un tiers et résultant des Spécifications, documents de construction, plans de récolement, plans d'atelier ou du développement, de la livraison ou de l’utilisation de tout ou partie du Modèle de construction par le Client ou par ledit tiers. Trimble ne fait aucune déclaration quant à la conformité du Modèle de construction avec les normes ou réglementations applicables dans les domaines du bâtiment et de la construction. Le Modèle de construction ne constitue pas un document de construction, un plan de récolement ou un plan d'atelier approuvé. Le Client devra consulter son service d’urbanisme local pour confirmer le respect des normes ou réglementations applicables en matière de construction. Avant de démarrer la construction, le Client fera valider le Modèle de construction et tous les documents de construction, plans, Spécifications et/ou modèles par un architecte agréé ou un ingénieur spécialisé.
7. Limitation des recours et des dommages-intérêts.
AUCUNE DES PARTIES N’EST RESPONSABLE DE TOUTE PERTE D'UTILISATION, INTERRUPTION D'ACTIVITÉ, PERTE DE BÉNÉFICES, NI REDEVABLE DE DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS INDIRECTS, SPÉCIAUX, ACCESSOIRES OU SECONDAIRES, QUELS QU'ILS SOIENT, RÉSULTANT DE OU LIÉS AUX SERVICES, INDÉPENDEMMENT DU FONDEMENT JURIDIQUE INVOQUÉ, QU'IL SOIT CONTRACTUEL, DÉLICTUEL (EN CE COMPRIS LA NÉGLIGENCE), RELÈVE DE LA RESPONSABILITÉ STRICTE OU AUTRE, MÊME SI ELLES ONT ÉTÉ INFORMÉES DE L'ÉVENTUALITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS À L'AVANCE. LA RESPONSABILITÉ GLOBALE DE TRIMBLE DÉCOULANT DE OU LIÉE À L’EXÉCUTION DES SERVICES NE PEUT EN AUCUN CAS EXCÉDER LE MONTANT NET EFFECTIVEMENT VERSÉ PAR LE CLIENT À TRIMBLE CONFORMÉMENT À L’EDP APPLICABLE À UNE TELLE RÉCLAMATION. CETTE LIMITE NE PEUT ÊTRE ÉTENDUE, QU’IL EXISTE UNE OU PLUSIEURS RÉCLAMATIONS. LE PRÉSENT PARAGRAPHE 7 NE S’APPLIQUE PAS AUX PARTIES DANS LE CAS D’UN MANQUEMENT CONFORMÉMENT AU PARAGRAPHE 8 (INFORMATIONS CONFIDENTIELLES), NI AU CLIENT DANS LE CAS D’UNE PLAINTE SURVENANT SUITE À UNE VIOLATION PAR LE CLIENT DES RESTRICTIONS DE LICENCE S’APPLIQUANT AUX DÉLIVRABLES CONFORMÉMENT AU PARAGRAPHE 5.2 (DÉLIVRABLES) OU DE SES OBLIGATIONS D’INDEMNISATION CONFORMÉMENT AUX PARAGRAPHES 6.2 ET 10. LES PARTIES CONVIENNENT QUE LES RESTRICTIONS ÉNONCÉES DANS LE PRÉSENT PARAGRAPHE 7 SURVIVRONT ET S'APPLIQUERONT MÊME DANS LA MESURE OÙ UN QUELCONQUE RECOURS LIMITÉ MENTIONNÉ DANS LES PRÉSENTES CONDITIONS S'AVÉRERAIT AVOIR MANQUÉ À SA FINALITÉ ESSENTIELLE.
8. Informations confidentielles.
8.1 Informations confidentielles. 
Chaque partie (« 
Partie réceptrice
 ») convient que tous les codes, inventions, savoir-faire et informations financières, techniques, commerciales transmis par la partie émettrice (« 
Partie émettrice
 ») sont confidentiels et propriété de la Partie émettrice (« 
Informations confidentielles
 »), sous réserve qu’ils soient qualifiés de confidentiels au moment de leur divulgation ou doivent être raisonnablement considérés comme tels par la Partie réceptrice compte tenu de leur nature et des circonstances de leur divulgation. Tout logiciel, toute documentation ou toute information technique fournis par Trimble (ou ses agents) et les présentes Conditions, les devis et les EDP sont réputés entrer dans la catégorie des Informations Confidentielles de Trimble sans nécessiter un quelconque marquage ni toute autre désignation complémentaire. Sauf autorisation expresse formulée dans les présentes, la Partie réceptrice préserve la confidentialité et s’interdit d'utiliser ou de divulguer toute Information confidentielle. La Partie réceptrice reconnaît que la divulgation des Informations confidentielles causerait un préjudice d'importance auquel il ne serait pas possible de remédier par le versement seul de dommages-intérêts et que par conséquent, à chaque divulgation faite par la Partie réceptrice, la Partie émettrice puisse prétendre à des mesures de redressement en équité, en complément de tous les autres recours dont elle pourrait disposer en droit.
8.2 Exclusions. 
L’obligation de non divulgation qui incombe à la Partie réceptrice ne s’applique pas aux informations pour lesquelles la Partie réceptrice peut prouver : (a) qu’elle en était légalement en possession ou en avait connaissance avant la réception des Informations confidentielles ; (b) qu’elles sont dans le domaine public ou y sont entrées sans qu'il y ait une faute de la Partie réceptrice ; (c) qu’elles ont été légalement obtenues par la Partie réceptrice auprès d’un tiers qui n’est soumis à aucune obligation de confidentialité ; (d) qu’elles sont développées indépendamment par des employés de la Partie réceptrice qui n’ont pas eu accès à ces informations ; ou (e) que leur divulgation était exigée par une réglementation, une loi ou une décision de justice (mais uniquement dans les strictes limites requises pour se conformer à cette réglementation ou décision et avec notification préalable de la Partie émettrice).
8.3 Utilisation et protection des Informations confidentielles. 
La Partie réceptrice peut utiliser les Informations confidentielles de la Partie émettrice uniquement dans le cadre de sa relation commerciale avec la Partie émettrice en vertu des présentes Conditions. Sauf stipulation expresse incluse dans les présentes, la Partie réceptrice ne divulgue à personne les Informations confidentielles de la Partie émettrice sans l'accord écrit préalable de la Partie émettrice. La Partie réceptrice prend toutes les mesures raisonnables afin d’éviter la divulgation, la diffusion ou l’utilisation non autorisée des Informations confidentielles de la Partie émettrice, ce qui implique au minimum les mêmes mesures de protection que celles appliquées à ses propres Informations confidentielles de nature semblable.

”) met Trimble (zoals hieronder gedefinieerd) heeft afgesloten, is de door Trimble aangeboden Dienstverlening (zoals hieronder gedefinieerd) onderworpen aan deze Servicevoorwaarden (“
Bepalingen 
”). 
“Trimble” 
staat voor Trimble Inc. en/of haar dochterondernemingen, zoals beschreven in de SOW (zoals hieronder gedefinieerd). Tegenstrijdige of aanvullende bepalingen of voorwaarden die op bestelformulieren of bijbehorende aankoopdocumentatie van de Klant worden vermeld, hebben geen rechtskracht.

“Wijzigingsdocument”
 genoemd), waarin de wijzigingen, eventuele noodzakelijke prijsaanpassingen en/of aanpassing van levertermijnen als gevolg van deze wijzigingen, alsmede andere noodzakelijke aanpassingen uitvoerig worden beschreven.

De Klant draagt de verantwoordelijkheid en het risico van mogelijke problemen voortvloeiend uit de inhoud, nauwkeurigheid en volledigheid van de Specificaties. Het Constructiemodel zal uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor het in de Werkomschrijving beschreven project. Indien het Constructiemodel wordt gebruikt door de Klant teneinde constructiedocumenten, bouwtekeningen of “shop-” tekeningen tot stand te brengen, wijst Trimble elke aansprakelijkheid en/of verantwoordelijkheid voor dergelijke constructiedocumenten, bouwtekeningen of shoptekeningen af. Het gebruiken of vertrouwen op een Constructiemodel door derden geschiedt voor eigen risico en zonder de aansprakelijkheid van Trimble. Indien de Klant het Constructiemodel openbaart aan derden, zal de Klant, voor zover wettelijk toegestaan, Trimble behoeden, schadeloosstellen en vrijwaren van vorderingen, claims, aanklachten, schade of aansprakelijkheid die door derden wordt ingeroepen tegen Trimble, en voortvloeien uit de Specificaties, constructiedocumenten, bouwtekeningen, shoptekeningen, of uit de ontwikkeling, aflevering of het gebruik van (een deel van ) het Constructiemodel door de Klant of door derden. Trimble onthoudt zich van toezeggingen m.b.t. de conformiteit van het Constructiemodel met relevante bouw- en constructiecodes of voorschriften. Het Constructiemodel kan niet worden beschouwd als een erkend constructiedocument, bouwtekening of shoptekening. De Klant raadpleegt het lokale orgaan belast met het bouwtoezicht om er zich van te verzekeren dat de toepasselijke bouwregels en voorschriften worden nageleefd. Alvorens de bouw te starten laat de Klant het Constructiemodel, alle constructiedocumenten, bouwtekeningen, Specificaties en/of modellen aftekenen door een bevoegde architect of handelingsbekwame ingenieur.

De Klant is gevestigd in: Verenigde Staten
Toepasselijk Recht: Californië en toepasselijke Amerikaanse federale wetgeving
Rechtsmachten met exclusieve bevoegdheid: Staats- en federale rechtbanken in Santa Clara County, CA
De Klant is gevestigd in: De rest van de wereld
Toepasselijk Recht: Nederland
Rechtsmachten met exclusieve bevoegdheid: Rechtbanken in Nederland
Vervolging of rechtsprocedures voortvloeiend uit of gerelateerd aan deze Bepalingen worden aangevangen in deze rechtsmachten, en de partijen onderwerpen zich onherroepelijk aan de bevoegdheid van deze rechtbanken. Het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties inzake internationale koopovereenkomsten van roerende zaken is niet van toepassing. Geschillen of rechtsvorderingen voortvloeiend uit deze Bepalingen kunnen door partijen uiterlijk een (1) jaar na het ontstaan van de oorzaak hiervan worden voorgelegd aan de rechter, met uitzondering van vorderingen voor het niet-nakomen van betaalverplichtingen, die uiterlijk twee (2) jaar na de uitgiftedatum van onbetaald gebleven factuur aanhangig kunnen worden gemaakt.
11.2 Onafhankelijke Contractanten. 
De partijen zijn onafhankelijke contractanten ten opzichte van elkaar en in geen geval medewerkers, vertegenwoordigers, partners of joint ventures van elkaar. Partijen onthouden zich ervan de wederpartij te verbinden of trachten te verbinden of aan te zetten tot het uitvoeren van enige verplichting. Geen van de partijen mag derden voorhouden dat het gerechtigd is om verplichtingen aan te gaan namens de andere partij. De partijen komen hierbij overeen dat er geen derden zijn die rechten kunnen ontlenen aan deze Bepalingen.
11.3 Overdracht; Bindende werking. 
Geen van de partijen kan deze Bepalingen overdragen zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijk toestemming van de andere partij, met dien verstande dat Trimble deze Bepalingen kan overdragen aan een dochteronderneming of in het geval van een fusie, reorganisatie, overname of soortgelijke overdracht van alle of nagenoeg alle activa of stemrecht gevende effecten van Trimble. Anderszins zijn deze Bepalingen bindend en komen ten goede aan de partijen en hun rechtsopvolgers en toegestane rechtverkrijgenden.
11.4 Berichten. 
Berichten, rapporten, toestemmingen of goedkeuringen die vereist (kunnen) zijn in het kader van deze Bepalingen geschieden schriftelijk aan het (de) in de SOW vermelde adres(sen), en worden geacht te zijn ontvangen: (a) indien persoonlijk afgeleverd, (b) vijf (5) dagen na de verzending van een aangetekend of gewaarmerkt schrijven, voorgefrankeerd en met ontvangstbewijs, of (c) een (1) dag na de verzending via een professionele 24/24-koerier met schriftelijk ontvangstbewijs. De Partijen kunnen hun postadres wijzigen middels de verzending van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de andere partij. Daarnaast moeten aan Trimble verstuurde berichten eveneens zijn voorzien van een kopie ter attentie van: Trimble Inc., Let op: General Counsel, Important Legal Notice, 935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA.
11.5 Overmacht. 
Met uitzondering van betalingsverplichtingen, is geen van de partijen aansprakelijk jegens de ander voor het niet-nakomen van haar verplichtingen, voor zover dit te wijten is aan een gebeurtenis die in alle redelijkheid buiten de invloedssfeer van de Partij ligt, met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot overheidsvoorschriften of -opdrachten, het uitbreken van een noodtoestand, natuurrampen, terroristische aanslagen, blokkades, oorlog, rellen en publieke ordeverstoringen, burgerlijke onrust, oproer, epidemieën, brand, stakingen, uitsluitingen, stroomstoringen of stroomuitval, storing of uitval van telecommunicatievoorzieningen, datanetwerken of diensten, of afwijzing van een licentieovereenkomst door een overheidsorgaan, of door (een) vergelijkbare oorza(a)k(en), mits de getroffen partij de andere partij, voor zover dat mogelijk is, onverwijld in kennis stelt van de gebeurtenis, en tracht de zakelijke gevolgen hiervan zoveel mogelijk te beperken.
11.6 Vrijstellingen
. Het afstand doen van rechten als gevolg van een schending van de Bepalingen door een van de partijen, ofwel expliciet ofwel impliciet, vormt geen afstanddoening van rechten als gevolg van enig andere schending of daaruit voortvloeiende schendingen. Van geen van deze voorwaarden of Bepalingen wordt afstand gedaan als gevolg van een handeling, fout of kennis van een partij, van haar vertegenwoordigers of medewerkers, tenzij er uitdrukkelijk in een schriftelijke verklaring afstand wordt gedaan van de rechten die kunnen worden ontleend aan een dergelijke bepaling, ondertekend door een bevoegde functionaris van de partij die afziet van haar rechten. Indien een van de voorwaarden van deze Bepalingen onuitvoerbaar of nietig wordt verklaard door een rechtbank of bevoegde jurisdictie, wordt deze voorwaarde zo beperkt mogelijk aangepast of verwijderd, zodat deze Bepalingen onverminderd van kracht en afdwingbaar blijven.
11.7 Titels. 
De in deze Bepalingen gebruikte titels dienen slechts voor referentiedoeleinden en zijn op geen enkele wijze van invloed op de betekenis en de interpretatie van deze Bepalingen
11.8 Volledige Overeenkomst. 
Bepalingen op bestelformulieren of andere door de Klant gebruikte bedrijfsformulieren overstijgen deze Bepalingen in geen geval, en deze op de Bepalingen betrekking hebbende documenten zijn uitsluitend voor administratieve doeleinden en hebben geen rechtsgevolgen. De partijen komen overeen dat deze Bepalingen, samen met de SOW, de volledige en exclusieve verklaring vormen van de wederzijdse afspraken tussen de partijen, en alle voormalige schriftelijke of mondelinge afspraken en communicatie tussen de partijen m.b.t. deze Bepalingen overstijgen en annuleren.
11.9 Officiële Taal 
. De officiële taal van deze Bepalingen is Engels. In geval van tegenstrijdigheden tussen in andere talen opgestelde versies van deze Bepalingen, prevaleert de Engelse versie.
11.10 Amendementen. 
Het afstand doen van rechten en wijzigingen of aanpassingen van deze Bepalingen, of overdracht van de rechten of verplichtingen van de Klant in het kader van een SOW zijn uitsluitend geldig of bindend ten aanzien van Trimble indien zij op schrift zijn gesteld en ondertekend door een bevoegde functionaris van Trimble.
11.11 Zelfstandige Activiteiten. 
De Klant accepteert dat geen van deze Bepalingen Trimble ervan weerhouden producten en diensten te leveren die overeenkomen of concurreren met de Dienstverlening en Deliverables, mits Trimble haar verplichtingen tot geheimhouding in het kader van deze Bepalingen niet schendt op grond van dergelijke activiteiten.
11.12 Rangorde. 
In geval van onverenigbaarheid, tegenstrijdigheid, of dubbelzinnigheid van deze Bepalingen, een SOW of gerelateerde overeenkomsten, gelden de documenten in de volgende rangorde: (a) deze Bepalingen; (b) gezamenlijk opgemaakte Wijzigingsdocumenten voor een SOW; (c) de SOW; en (d) andere documenten waarnaar uitdrukkelijk wordt verwezen in een Wijzigingsdocument en/of de SOW. In geval van documenten van dezelfde categorie met dezelfde rangorde, prevaleert de voorwaarde of bepaling waarop de kortst geleden datum wordt vermeld. Informatie die wordt vermeld in het ene document, maar niet in het andere, wordt niet beschouwd als onverenigbaar of tegenstrijdig
11.3 Exemplaren. 
De SOW kan in een onbeperkt aantal exemplaren worden opgesteld, die stuk voor stuk worden beschouwd als originelen, en die gezamenlijk één volledig ondertekend origineel vormen. Facsimile en andere vormen van elektronische handtekeningen op de SOW zijn bindend.
