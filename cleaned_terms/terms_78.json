  "terms": "Privacy Policy vs Terms and Conditions\n\nA Privacy Policy is a public document that discloses how a party collects, uses, and shares personal data. It’s a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, especially for websites handling user data. A Terms and Conditions document outlines the rules and guidelines for using a website or service.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the key differences:\n\n**Privacy Policy:** Focuses on how a website collects and protects user data.  It’s a legal obligation in many areas.\n\n**Terms and Conditions:**  Sets rules and expectations for how users must use a website or service. They’re more focused on the agreement between the website and user.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** Privacy Policies protect users; Terms and Conditions define the user's rights and responsibilities.\n*   **Scope:** Privacy Policies are broader, covering all data collected. Terms and Conditions are more specific to the service’s usage.\n*   **Legal Compliance:** Privacy Policies are often legally mandated; Terms and Conditions are generally more flexible."
