3. Scope of Google Pay Services


Google Pay ("
Google Pay
" or "
Google Pay App
") is a payment solution application which facilitates Google Pay Service. Through Google Pay, you may send payments to service providers, Users, Merchants, Billers or third parties using any Payment Instruments accepted through Google Pay. You may also receive payments from other Users or third parties in the Payment Instrument you designated in Google Pay to receive funds. In addition, Google Pay allows you to communicate with or receive communications, offers and services from other Users, service providers, Banks, Merchants and Billers. In relation to UPI Payment Transactions, Google Pay is a TPAP authorised by NPCI to facilitate Payment Transactions through HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India. We are a service provider and participate in UPI through PSP Banks. We are bound by tripartite agreements entered with NPCI and each of our the sponsor PSP’s - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and State Bank of India. For the exact roles and responsibilities of Google Pay, PSP and NPCI in a UPI Payment Transaction, please refer 
here
. For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to UPI Transactions, you are subject to that PSP's terms and conditions. Further, the use and processing by a PSP Bank of your personal data available to the PSP Bank during or pursuant to UPI Transactions is subject to the privacy policy available on the PSP Bank's website.


Google Pay may facilitate provision of third party products or services to you within Google Pay. These third party products or services are offered by parties other than Google, and are subject to third party terms. You may need to accept additional terms and conditions and meet additional requirements to use these third party services. You should only transact with a third party product or service that you trust. Google will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss incurred by you as a result of your interaction with a third party product or service on Google Pay.


Mechanics of Payment Transaction
. The Payment Transactions or any communication/offers carried out through Google Pay are solely between the Sender and Recipient of the payment. Google Pay creates a link between the Sender, the Recipient and the respective Payments System Providers to facilitate sending and/or receiving payments using Payments System Provider Services. Once a Payment Transaction has been authenticated, authorised and processed through the Payments System Provider Services:


(i) the payment may be settled directly with the Recipient by the respective Payments Participants; or


(ii) in certain scenarios, we may act as an intermediary and receive funds pertaining to the Payment Transaction on behalf of the Recipient. In such scenarios, Google would operate purely as the Recipient’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting funds from Users.


Google’s Role in Payment Transactions
. You understand and agree to the following:




Google is only a facilitator of Payment Transactions.


Google is not a party to these Payment Transactions.


Google is not a Payments System Provider.


Google may, in certain scenarios, act as an intermediary and operate as a payment collection agent for the limited purpose of receiving funds on behalf of the Recipient.


Google is not and will not be responsible for any aspect of the products or services you purchase.


Google is not and will not be responsible for any communications made by you or any communication or offers made to you through Google Pay.


Google is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes, chargebacks or reversals arising pursuant to Payment Transactions.


Google is not responsible for any act of Users, including, non-completion of a Transaction.


The facilitation of a Transaction does not guarantee that the Sender has sufficient funds available in the Funding Account he or she used, that the Transaction will be authorized or processed, or that the Transaction will not later result in a chargeback or other reversal.


Google is neither acting as a trustee nor acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to any Payment Transaction.


Google does not determine, advise or in any manner control the commercial terms of the Payment Transaction, including the price of products and services offered for sale.




Disclaimer of Google’s Liability
. Google is not responsible for any aspect of the products or services you purchase or for any communications or offers made to you. Google’s role as a payment collection agent for the Recipient will not make Google liable or responsible for breach of representations and warranties, non-provision of after-sales or warranty services or fraud vis-a-vis the products and/or services sold by a Merchant.


Bill Payment Services
. Google Pay facilitates bill payment services that allow You to view Your bills or eligible pre-paid plans and make payments to Billers through the Google Pay App. You understand that the Bill Payment Services provided through Google Pay are either provided (i) by a Bharat Connect Operating Unit ("BCOU") under the Bharat Connect ("BC") infrastructure, where the Biller is registered with NPCI to participate within BC; or (ii) by a Biller aggregator with whom Google has entered into a contractual arrangement. You further understand that Google Pay only facilitates bill presentment and bill payment and is either (i) an agent of the BCOU in accordance with Applicable Law, where the Biller is registered with NPCI for BC; or (ii) a bill payment facilitator through integrations with third parties providing these services, eg; prepaid recharges through resellers/distributors of these recharges and/or through direct integration with telecom service providers.


Credit Card Services
. Google Pay provides a technology platform for display of Credit Card offers from Credit Institutions to You.

Google’s role vis-a-vis such Credit Cards shall be limited to providing technology services related to Credit Cards offered by Credit Institutions and collaborating with Credit Institutions to provide services and offers related to Credit Cards that may be uniquely available to Google Pay users (e.g., Axis Bank ACE Card, which is issued by Axis Bank and marketed in collaboration with Google).


Loan Facility Services
. Google Pay provides a technology platform for display of Loan Facility offers from Lending third parties to You. You understand and agree that the terms of such Loan Facility shall be governed by the loan agreements executed between You and the Lending third party. Google is not a party to such loan agreements and Google’s role in such transactions shall be limited to that of an intermediary technology platform.

Google does not exercise any control or oversight over catalogue, inventory, pricing, logistics, warehouse management, delivery or fulfillment. You will be solely responsible for managing your Business Page, its content and transactions. Google’s role would merely be that of a technology service provider to you, assisting you with setting up your Business Page. Any real-time communication regarding the product or service under Business Pages would be between you and the buyer, with no Google interference. Google does not provide any customer support for Business Pages or assist in tracking status of a transaction. Google makes no warranty and shall bear no obligation on the quality of the products, services or information obtained by a user on Business Pages, or that such products or services will meet the user's expectations. You will be responsible towards your customers for any complaints or disputes that they have, and Google shall not be responsible for any customer grievance on Business Pages.

Once you have registered for BHIM UPI services, you can send payments from your bank account or receive payments into your bank account using BHIM UPI through Google Pay.

You further agree and specifically consent to Google onboarding you on the centralised mapper operated by the NPCI (i.e., the Numeric UPI ID Mapper) and any other databases as the NPCI may require and notify from time to time. The ‘UPI Number’ will be your [registered mobile number] by default, and by agreeing to allow the onboarding of your UPI Number to the centralised mapper(s) of the NPCI, you will be able to send and / or receive funds on the Google Pay App using your ‘UPI Number’. The onboarding process will be in accordance with the NPCI’s guidelines and directions. You understand and agree that Google is entitled to act as per the instructions of the NPCI, which includes (without limitation) sharing your UPI details with the NPCI and linking your primary bank account or your UPI ID (virtual payment address) to your ‘UPI Number’. Once onboarded in the centralised mapper(s), you will be able to use your UPI Number to send and / or receive funds. You may choose to delink the default mapping of your UPI Number at any time by [updating the settings] on the Google Pay App.

Virtual Account Numbers may be used: (i) at participating merchant locations, using a QR code through your Google Pay App that resides on your mobile device, or (ii) online through certain merchant apps, or (iii) on your Google Pay app for processing bill payments or other merchant Payment Transactions. Google Pay does not store the actual number of the underlying debit card or credit card and only saves the Virtual Account Number.


After you have begun to add a Virtual Account Number to Google Pay, Google Pay will check whether the payment method is eligible. If your payment method’s issuer supports Google Pay and your payment method is eligible, when adding it you may see a screen asking you to accept the issuer’s terms and conditions. Once you have done so and successfully added the payment method, Google Pay will store a Virtual Account Number representing your payment method’s actual card number or other identifier with your Google Account for use with Google Pay.


Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are a party to your payment methods’ user agreement, privacy policy, or other terms of use. Nothing in these Combined Google Pay Terms modifies any such issuer terms. In the event of any inconsistency between these Combined Google Pay Terms and your issuer’s terms or privacy policy, these Combined Google Pay Terms will govern the relationship between you and Google with respect to Google Pay, and your issuer’s terms will govern the relationship between you and the issuer. Google does not make any representation or verify that any of your payment methods is in good standing or that the issuer of your payment method will authorize or approve any transaction with a merchant or transit provider when you use Google Pay for that transaction.


Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are involved in issuing credit or determining eligibility for credit, nor do they exercise control over: the availability or accuracy of payment methods or funds; the provisioning (or addition) of payment methods to Google Pay, or addition of funds to payment method balances. Your Issuer provides services to register or deregister your Virtual Account Number for specific uses and to set and modify Payment Transaction limits. For any concerns relating to the foregoing, please contact your payment method’s issuer.

You may have additional refund or chargeback rights under your Payment Instrument issuer agreement or under applicable regulations. You should review the statements you receive from the issuer of your Payment Instrument which should reflect all Transactions through the Google Pay Services.

Disputes
.

Use of Google Pay Services in no way represents any endorsement by Google of any User, Biller, Merchant or third party. You should ensure that you have undertaken adequate due diligence prior to transferring payments to anyone using Google Pay Services. Any dispute is between the Sender and Recipient without making Google and/or the Payments System Providers, a party to such disputes. However, in relation to UPI Payment Transactions, we are responsible for facilitating grievances / complaints resolution for Users. We shall be the first point of contact for all UPI Payment Transaction related grievances/complaints for Users.

After exercising these options you can approach the Banking Ombudsman and or the Ombudsman for Digital Complaints, as the case may be.


In addition, if you choose to use your BHIM UPI or Credit Card credentials created through Google Pay to send payments to a merchant or third party who is not using Google Pay Services for the purpose of processing and/or settlement of funds, Google’s role will be limited to providing the payment instructions to the Payments System Provider. Google will neither be responsible for the processing or settlement of the Transaction nor for any delivery or service fulfilment, provided Google may, in certain circumstances, act as a payment collection agent for the Recipient for the limited purpose of receiving funds on the Recipient’s behalf. It is your responsibility to ensure that the correct information has been provided by you or that you have selected the correct Recipient.


Google is not obligated to mediate disputes between Senders and Recipients or between the Sender/Recipient and the Payment Participants. However, Google will assist Users in communicating with each other regarding a dispute or in sending the User’s complaint to the respective Payment Participant, if required under Applicable Laws or Payment Participant Rules.
