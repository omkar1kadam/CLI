Fees and payment




All Products are provided on a subscription basis (a “
Subscription
”) for the term specified in your Order(s) (a “
Subscription Term
”). All Fees are payable in advance and are non-refundable, save as expressly stated in this Agreement. A notice of renewal will be sent to your email at least 90 days from the end of each Subscription Term notifying you that your Subscription is due to renew for an additional Subscription Term.


You shall notify us immediately in the event you cease to comply with any of the restrictions applicable to any of your then current Orders. In the event we receive your notice, or we deem acting reasonably that you have exceeded the restrictions of an Order (including the number of Users permitted), we reserve the right to change your Order in accordance with clause 3, which may result in additional Fees being payable by you. We reserve the right to deduct such Fees from your original method of payment or invoice you for the additional amount.


If you made a payment for your Subscription(s) using an online payment processing service (operated by us or by one of our payment processing partners such as Stripe) you hereby authorise us to use the payment credentials provided by you for any Fees due for any Subscription Terms which are renewed in accordance with clause 7.1. Any invoices are payable within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date. If we do not receive your payment by the applicable due date, we reserve the right (a) to charge interest on all invoices presented to you which are not paid by the applicable due date at the annual rate of 4% above the base rate from time to time of the Bank of England, such interest to accrue on a daily basis from the date on which payment became overdue up to the date on which SIA receives the full outstanding amount together with all accrued interest, whether before or after judgement; and (b) to withhold or suspend your access to the Product(s) and/or terminate your Order(s) or this Agreement.


We reserve the right to increase the Fees at any time on notice to you, which shall take effect from the start of the next applicable Subscription Term following the Subscription Term in which we gave notice to you. Fees for all Products will increase by at least 5% upon each renewal of a Subscription Term unless otherwise notified to you or agreed between the parties in writing.


All Fees payable hereunder are exclusive of VAT or other sales tax, which will be added at the applicable rate and all payments to be made by you hereunder shall be made without set-off, compensation, deduction or counterclaim and without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, fees, deductions, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature whatsoever. If at any time any applicable law requires you to make any such deduction or withholding from any such payment, the sum due from you with respect to such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, we receive a net sum equal to the sum which we would have received had no deduction or withholding been required.






Duration, suspension and termination of your orders




Your Subscription Term(s) shall be for the period as specified in the applicable Order and commencing on the date specified in the Order and each applicable Subscription Term shall automatically renew for equivalent Subscription Terms (for example, if your initial Subscription Term is two years, each applicable renewal term shall be two years) unless you have given notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the end of the applicable Subscription Term, or unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.


We may suspend your access to one or more Products or suspend or terminate all or any part of your Order(s) or this Agreement immediately on notice to you in the event that:



you fail to comply with one or more material provisions of this Agreement or, if you have concurrent contracts with us for different Products, any other agreement which you may have entered into with us;


we believe that there has been fraudulent use, misuse or abuse of features and functionalities of any of our Products (in whole or in part); or
