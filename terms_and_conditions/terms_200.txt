                    Terms & Conditions of Sale
                












These terms and conditions (these “Terms”) apply to the sale of materials, goods, and merchandise regardless of type (“Products”). The business entity selling Products is referred to as “Seller” and the business entity or individual purchasing Products is referred to as “Buyer.” These Terms shall govern and be incorporated into any sale of Products by Seller to Buyer. Any terms in Seller’s quote, Buyer’s purchase order, order form, remittance communication, a written order confirmation from Seller (“Seller’s Order Confirmation”), or any other document which conflict with or are in addition to these Terms are deemed to be material alterations to these Terms and, except to the extent they are (in Seller’s sole opinion) more favorable to Seller than the terms stated herein or accepted by Seller in writing, notice is given to Buyer that any such terms are rejected. The sale of Products is expressly conditioned on Buyer’s acceptance of these Terms. No quotation by Seller and no written or oral order of Buyer shall become a binding obligation of Seller unless and until Seller has accepted, a purchase order from Buyer, in writing, on Seller's form of purchase order and issued a Seller Order Confirmation.




PRICE:
 The purchase price of Products is set forth in Seller’s quote or Buyer’s Purchase Order to the extent accepted by Seller in Seller’s Order Confirmation. Such purchase price is only valid through the estimated delivery date as shown on Seller’s Order Confirmation and is subject to increase if delivery acceptance is delayed. The purchase price includes standard packaging. In addition to the purchase price, notwithstanding any FOB or Incoterms shipping terms mentioned in these Terms, Buyer must pay: (a) all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local sales, use, excise, ad valorem, VAT, and other taxes, and all duties and fees imposed by any governmental authority, including, but not limited to, any interest and penalties thereon, imposed upon the sale, delivery, use, or installation of Products; (b) any shipping, freight, insurance, duties, and other costs and charges (including handling) associated with delivery to Buyer; and (c) all upcharges, including upcharges for custom orders. In the event any such costs are paid by Seller, Buyer, upon receipt of an invoice from Seller, will promptly reimburse Seller for same.




INSTALLATION NOT INCLUDED:
 Installation of Products is the responsibility of Buyer and is not included in pricing. Seller recommends that certified dealers of Seller be engaged for installation of Products and provides notice to Buyer that the Limited Warranty is made expressly conditional on Product installation in accordance with Seller’s installation instructions (available upon request).




CUSTOM ORDERS:
 All custom orders are subject to applicable upcharges and a 10% production overrun. Custom orders may not be changed or returned. Buyer assumes full liability for payment on all custom orders, whether in the form of raw materials, workin- process, or finished goods.




ORDER CHANGES:
 All order change and cancellation requests are subject to Seller approval and Seller reserves the right to use its sole judgment and discretion when and under what circumstances it will approve a change to or cancellation of an order; custom orders may not be canceled by Buyer under any circumstances. In the event Buyer desires to cancel any order after Seller’s Order Confirmation has been sent to Buyer, Buyer shall be charged a minimum fee of 25%  of the purchase price, which fee shall be due and payable to Seller within 30 days of cancellation. Buyer and Seller agree that the damages which Seller would incur in the event of cancellation are difficult to estimate and that the cancellation fee is a reasonable estimate of the likely damages in such event.




INSPECTION:
 Buyer must inspect Products immediately upon delivery and report shortages or issues to Seller no later than 10 days after receipt. Failure to inspect and report within 10 days after receipt may, at Seller’s sole discretion, result in forfeiture of Buyer’s right to further action, and Buyer will be held responsible for the entire invoice amount. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any defects, shortages or nonconformities in Products are discoverable by inspection upon delivery of Products to Buyer, all obligations of Seller to Buyer with respect to such defects, shortages, or nonconformities (other than Seller's obligations under the Limited Warranty set forth below) shall be deemed to be waived by Buyer unless Buyer notifies Seller of such defects, shortages, or nonconformities in writing within sixty (60) days after delivery of Products. No action, regardless of form, arising out of or in connection with the sale of Products hereunder (other than an action by Seller for any amount due to Seller by Buyer) may be brought more than one year after the cause of action has arisen.




RETURNS:
 All returns are subject to Seller approval and must comply with Seller’s return policies as communicated by Seller at the time of return. No partial returns will be accepted. No adhesives will be accepted for return. At Seller’s discretion, a restocking charge of 45% or more of the purchase price of Products may be charged on returns; credit will only be issued on receipt of material that is NEW and in SALEABLE condition.




BUYER DEFAULT:
 Buyer shall be in default hereunder if: (a) Buyer fails to make any payment when due hereunder, or otherwise defaults, breaches, or repudiates any obligation to Seller, whether contained herein or otherwise; (b) Buyer becomes insolvent or is unable to pay, or is generally not paying, its debts as they mature; (c) Buyer makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (d) a trustee, receiver, or other custodian is appointed for any Products or all or a substantial portion of Buyer's property; or (e) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or arrangement proceeding is instituted by or against Buyer. If Buyer is in default hereunder, Seller, in addition to any other rights it has under applicable law, shall have the right to: (i) cancel any quote, Purchase Order, and any other transaction with Buyer (Buyer remaining liable for damages); (ii) defer any shipments hereunder; (iii) subject to applicable law and notice requirements, declare immediately due and payable all amounts due and payable to Seller in connection with these Terms, any other transaction, including, (but not limited to), amounts due and payable for Products delivered hereunder; (iv) recover damages arising from Buyer's default, including, but not limited to, costs, and lost profit; (v) recover all costs of collection, including, without limitation, any extrajudicial attorney’s fees incurred in the process; (vi) exercise all rights available to an aggrieved seller and/or a secured party under applicable law; and/or (vii) sell all or any portion of undelivered Products, without notice, at public or private sale (Buyer to be responsible for all costs and expenses of such sale and any deficiency). Buyer hereby waives any and all rights to notice and hearing prior to repossession of Products upon Buyer's default. Seller's rights hereunder shall be cumulative and in addition to any and all other rights available to Seller under applicable law.




LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; BUYER INDEMNITY:
 To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Seller be liable, whether in contract or in tort or under any other legal theory (including negligence and strict liability), for lost profits or revenues, or special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or similar damages, arising out of or in connection with the sale, delivery, non-delivery, servicing, installation, use, maintenance, or possession of Products, or for any claim made against Buyer, even if Seller has been advised of the possibility of such claim. IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER'S LIABILITY UNDER ANY CLAIM MADE BY BUYER EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF PRODUCTS IN RESPECT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS MADE. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees), irrespective of the theory upon which such claims are based, including, but not limited to, negligence and strict liability, that Seller suffers or incurs as a result of any claims, demands, or actions against Seller by third parties arising out of the sale, delivery, non-delivery, installation or servicing of Products, or in connection with the use, condition, installation, possession, operation, ownership, selection, transportation, loading, unloading, maintenance, or return of any of Products, including (but not limited to) claims for injury to property or person (including death); except that Buyer shall have no liability for any such amounts arising out of the sole negligence of Seller.




FORCE MAJEURE:
 Seller shall not be liable for any default or delay in performance if caused, directly or indirectly, by fire, flood, earthquake, acts of God, strikes, riots or civil disorders, unavoidable casualty, governmental order or state of war, accidents, epidemic, pandemic, quarantine, interruptions of transportation facilities or delays in transit, supply shortages, failure of any party to perform any contract with Seller relative to the production of Products, failure of computers or equipment to properly process dates, or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the causes enumerated herein, beyond the reasonable control of Seller. Seller shall notify Buyer of the occurrence of any such contingency, and if performance by Seller is delayed, the period for performance shall be extended for a reasonable period of time. A force majeure event shall not affect Buyer’s obligation to pay any amount that is due and payable.

 Buyer acknowledges that the sale, resale, distribution, export, and/or re-export of Products supplied to Buyer may be subject to compliance with economic sanctions, export control, anti-corruption, and other applicable laws and regulations. Buyer agrees, with respect to Products supplied to Buyer, to comply with all such applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to not providing, directly or indirectly, any Products to a party identified on any applicable government sanctions list. With respect to Products provided to Buyer, Buyer will not offer or provide bribes, incentives, or anything of value to any party in violation of applicable anti-corruption law. Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller with such information as Seller reasonably determines is necessary for compliance with laws specified in this provision. To the extent of Buyer’s breach of its obligations pursuant to this paragraph, Buyer shall defend, hold harmless, and indemnify Seller, as well as Seller’s affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents, at its own expense and in a timely fashion, from and against any and all fines, penalties, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses, including but not limited to amounts paid in settlement and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

			 
			




PAYMENT:
 Payment of the invoiced amount for Products is due within 30 days of the date of Seller’s invoice unless Seller approves credit terms for Buyer in advance in writing. Seller will evaluate Buyer’s creditworthiness and extend and change credit terms in Seller’s sole discretion and Seller reserves the right to require cash payment in advance of production or shipment. Payment must be made in the same currency as invoiced and shall be made without discount. Any payment received from or for the account of Buyer may be accepted or applied by Seller against any indebtedness or obligation owing by Buyer as shown by the books and records of Seller, without prejudice to, or discharge of, the remainder of any such indebtedness or obligation, regardless of any, statement, legend, or notation appearing on, referring to or accompanying such payment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller reserves the right to charge fees for credit card transactions as indicated on the applicable Seller’s Order Confirmation.




LATE FEES:
 Time is of the essence with respect to all payments due hereunder. A late fee equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month (18% annually), or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, may be imposed at Seller's option on all past due amounts until such amounts are paid in full. In the event any payment due Seller is collected at law, through or under advice from an attorney-atlaw, or through a collection agency, Buyer agrees to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including, but not limited to, all court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and expenses incurred by Seller in attempting to collect past due amounts.




DELIVERY:
 Time shall not be of the essence with respect to delivery of Products and Seller does not guarantee any delivery date; any estimated delivery date is an estimate based on current and anticipated factory loads and shipping timelines. Products are shipped FOB Seller’s shipping location. Seller agrees to make arrangements for and on behalf of Buyer, for the carriage and insurance of Products on such carrier, by such means of shipment, and insured by such insurer, as determined by Seller in its discretion. Any arrangements made and expenses incurred by Seller for carriage and insurance of Products will be billed to Buyer, and will be due and payable upon invoice (as described in the “Price” section of these Terms). Seller may ship Products in partial shipments and Seller reserves the right to invoice for partial shipments. Invoices for partial shipments shall be due and payable in accordance with these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shipment is international, Incoterms 2020 Ex Works (EXW) Seller’s shipping location applies. Buyer must provide shipping instructions promptly upon request of Seller; if Buyer fails to provide shipping instructions for allocated Product promptly upon request, Seller may charge, and Buyer must pay, a monthly storage fee of up to 10% of the purchase price of allocated Product (no partial month proration will be applied). In addition, if Buyer is unable or refuses to accept delivery of any Products, then, in addition to any applicable cancellation fee, Buyer shall pay to Seller all costs incurred by Seller as a result of such inability or refusal to accept delivery, including without limitation reasonable costs of shipping, storage, insurance, and handling.
