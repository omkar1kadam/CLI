YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE TOOLS ARE PROVIDED MERELY AS A CONVENIENCE TO OUR USERS, AND THAT YOU RETAIN ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT WHILE USING THE SERVICES. THE DEDUCTION MAXIMIZER IS INTENDED TO HIGHLIGHT CERTAIN COMMONLY-USED DEDUCTIONS FOR FILERS LISTING A PARTICULAR OCCUPATION. IT IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE, BASED ON YOUR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, IF SUCH DEDUCTIONS APPLY TO YOU AND IF OTHER DEDUCTIONS, THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE TOOL, MAY APPLY TO YOU.
You are the only person authorized to use your user identification and password, and you shall not permit or allow other people to have access to or use the same.

TaxAct reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.
TaxAct reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in TaxAct’s sole discretion. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any Communication Service.

Managers and hosts are not authorized TaxAct spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of TaxAct.
Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you download the materials.
TaxAct may use AI-powered chatbots and similar features on some of the Services to provide helpful information. By using this service, you are interacting with an AI platform, not a live person.

 4. Electronic Filing Services 
If you choose to file your return electronically, your tax return will be forwarded to TaxAct’s Electronic Filing Center, where it will be converted to and stored in a standardized format and then, transmitted to the applicable federal or state taxing authority. TaxAct cannot guarantee that the taxing authority will accept your return, as rejections may occur due to circumstances beyond TaxAct’s control (e.g., incorrect user information, malfunction of the taxing authority’s system, etc.). Your e-filing fee, if any, is non-refundable even if your return is rejected by the taxing authority. You are responsible for verifying the status of your return to confirm that it has been received and accepted by the applicable taxing authority and, if necessary, for filing it manually. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires TaxAct to provide notification to it of information relating to your use of the Services, such as notice of your electronic filing of your tax return, of the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other device information of the computer from which your return originated, and of whether your email address was collected. By using the Services to prepare and submit your tax return, you consent to the disclosure to the IRS and any other tax authority, revenue authority, or other governmental authority with jurisdiction of any information pertaining to your use of the Services. You agree that TaxAct is permitted to access and use any tax return and other information provided by you to perform the Services and, if necessary, to access such information to obtain contact information in order to provide you with notifications relating to the Services.
 
 5. Modifications to the Services 
TaxAct has the right at any time and for any reason to modify or discontinue the Services or any aspect or feature of the Services, including but not limited to their Content, functionality or hours of availability, the equipment needed for its access or use, or pricing. In addition, TaxAct reserves the right, at any time, to change the terms of this Agreement. 
 
 6. TaxAct Guarantees for Registered Users 
TaxAct offers the following guarantees with respect to the Services: 
Maximum Refund Guarantee
$100k Accuracy Guarantee
100% Satisfaction Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct Online products only)
Money-Back Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct download products only)
100% Accuracy Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct Business products only)
For all of the details of how our guarantees work – what’s covered, what’s excluded, required time frames, and what steps are required – please read the full terms below:
UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED BY LAW, THE BELOW GUARANTEES SET FORTH YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST TAXACT, ITS AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OUR ONLY OBLIGATION, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ERRORS OR INACCURANCIES WITH OUR SERVICES. GUARANTEES ARE DISTINCT AND MAY NOT BE COMBINED.
Maximum Refund Guarantee
We guarantee you’ll get your maximum tax refund if you use one of TaxAct’s individual 1040 products (the “Service”) to e-file your return. If you are a registered user of the Service and you receive a larger refund amount or pay a smaller tax due amount on your federal and/or state tax return using an online tax preparation software other than the TaxAct software, then we will refund to you the applicable federal and/or state purchase price paid by you for the Service. All other fees are excluded. To qualify, the larger refund or smaller tax due cannot be attributed to variations in data you provided for tax preparation or for positions taken by you or another online tax preparation software that are contrary to the law. To make a claim under this guarantee, you must notify us in writing, as soon as you learn of the difference (and in no event later than 60 days from the date you filed your tax return using the Service or October 31 of the applicable tax year, if earlier). See 
https://www.taxact.com/company/guarantees
 for more details and how to submit a Maximum Refund Guarantee claim.
$100k Accuracy Guarantee
We guarantee our software is 100% accurate and will calculate your maximum refund under applicable law. If an error in our software results in you ultimately receiving a smaller refund or larger tax liability than you receive using the same data with another tax preparation product, we will: (1) refund the applicable software fees you paid us, (2) pay you the difference in the tax refund or liability, (3) cover any penalties and interest levied against you and (4) any reasonably documented legal and audit costs you incur. In no event will our total, cumulative obligation under (1)-(4) above to any customer under this guarantee exceed $100,000. This guarantee only extends to returns that are e-filed by taxpayers preparing their own tax returns using our Consumer 1040 products (e.g., those located at 
https://www.taxact.com/taxes-online
) starting in the 2017 tax year. Our other offerings (including, without limitation, our products for businesses (TaxAct Business) and tax professionals (TaxAct Professional)) as well as our Consumer 1040 products for past tax years have their own guarantees and are expressly excluded from this guarantee. This guarantee only applies to errors contained in our software, and does not apply to errors attributable to the user, including without limitation if a user: (i) overrides any amounts generated by the software, (ii) misclassifies or fails to enter any information completely or accurately, (iii) makes incorrect or fraudulent claims, or (iv) fails to file an amended return after we announce any updates or corrections to the software. This guarantee sets forth your sole and exclusive remedy, and our only obligation, in the event of any errors with our software. To make a claim under this guarantee, you must submit a claim within 60 days from the date you e-filed your return or within 30 days of the IRS or state imposing a penalty, and provide any other information we reasonably request, within a timely manner but no more than 60 days after we request such information, to allow us to evaluate and verify your claim. Once we receive your claim and the necessary information, we will review it and respond to you within 90 days. This Guarantee does not apply when using the applicable TaxAct product or service to prepare tax returns for others. See 
https://www.taxact.com/company/guarantees
 for more details and how to submit an $100K Accuracy Guarantee claim.
100% Satisfaction Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct Online products only)
If you are a registered user using the Services online and are dissatisfied with the Services prior to completing the billing steps within the program, your exclusive remedy is to immediately discontinue using the Services. If you are a registered user who completed the billing steps and have not printed or e-filed or your e-file was rejected by the IRS or State and you cannot re-file, you must contact us within the calendar year of the purchase to request a refund of fee(s) paid. See 
https://www.taxact.com/company/guarantees
 for more details and how to submit a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee claim. 
Money-Back Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct download products only)
If you are a TaxAct download purchaser and you’re not completely satisfied with your TaxAct download software purchase, you can request a full refund within 30 days of receipt to get your money back. The Money-Back Guarantee does not apply after you use the TaxAct software to print or e-file a return and that return is accepted by the IRS or state taxing agency. See 
https://www.taxact.com/company/guarantees
 for more details and how to submit a Money-Back Guarantee claim. 
100% Accuracy Guarantee (Applies to TaxAct Business products only)
Rest assured — our calculations are correct. If you are assessed a penalty from the IRS or state taxing authority due to a calculation error in a TaxAct product, we'll pay the penalty and interest. To make a claim under this guarantee, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the IRS or state imposing a penalty. This Guarantee does not apply (i) when using the applicable TaxAct product or service to prepare tax returns for others or (iii) if you fail to enter all required information accurately. See 
https://www.taxact.com/company/one-hundred-percent-accuracy
 for more details and how to submit an 100% Accuracy Guarantee claim.

The notice of dispute must contain enough information for us to identify all relationship(s) that you have with TaxAct and to attempt to resolve your claim, including (a) your name; (b) the email address(es) that you used when using the Services; (c) your mobile telephone number; (d) your residential address; (e) an explanation of the facts of the dispute as you understand them and supporting information; and (f) a good faith calculation of the damages you claim to have suffered and a statement of the specific relief you are seeking. During the 60 days following the date your notice of dispute is received by TaxAct, you and we agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute informally and you will not initiate any legal action during this period. You and we agree to toll any statutes of limitations that may apply, along with any filing deadlines during this 60-day time period. If you commence an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of dispute, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration pending compliance with this paragraph.
Class Waiver
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND TAXACT AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND TAXACT AND THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A COLLECTIVE ACTION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
If there is a final determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the Class Waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy will be severed and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the waiver contained in this paragraph shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other claims, causes of action or requested remedies to the fullest extent possible. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.
Agreement to Binding Individual Arbitration
In the unlikely event that an agreed upon solution is not reached within sixty (60) days from the date your notice of dispute is received (and the parties do not agree to extend the period), you and we agree that any disagreement between you and TaxAct regarding any claim or controversy at law or equity arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services (collectively, "Dispute") will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration in Dallas County, Texas or the location of the registered user, or as we and you otherwise agree in writing. You agree that the term "Dispute" in this Agreement will have the broadest meaning possible. This Agreement also cover any Dispute between you and any officer, director, board member, agent, employee, affiliate of TaxAct, or third party if TaxAct could be liable, directly or indirectly, for such Dispute. If the parties have more than one Dispute between them, you and we agree to assert all such Disputes in a single arbitration so they may be resolved at the same time or they will be deemed waived.
Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), You and TaxAct agree to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitrator. If we are unable to agree on an arbitrator or arbitration firm, you and TaxAct agree that the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures as modified by these Terms, but excluding any rules or procedures that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”). The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at 
https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures
. 
WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You and TaxAct agree that the terms of this Agreement affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "
FAA
"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. You and TaxAct agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and TaxAct will pay the remaining arbitration provider’s fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by TaxAct, TaxAct will pay all of the arbitration provider’s fees and costs. You and TaxAct agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Texas and the United States sitting in Dallas County, Texas have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following Disputes (i) qualifying individual Disputes in small claims court in the county of your or TaxAct’s billing address. and/or (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction in Texas for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property. 
Mass Arbitrations
In the event twenty-five (25) same or more similar Disputes sharing common issues of fact or law are asserted against TaxAct at or around the same time by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise consistent or coordinated, you and we agree that the demands will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines shall apply.
Further, if your Dispute is part of a Mass Arbitration, you agree that TaxAct, in its sole discretion, may elect to opt your Disputes out of arbitration and require the Dispute to proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas consistent with the remainder of this Agreement, including the class and collective action waiver. 
Termination of Rights
ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES OR CONTENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND TAXACT WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.
