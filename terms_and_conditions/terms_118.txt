Whatâs a Rich Text element?
The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.
Static and dynamic content editing
A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!
How to customize formatting for each rich text
Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the "When inside of" nested selector system.

Terms and conditions of sale template
Use this terms and conditions of sale agreement template to help simplify your sales process.
Our templates are for general information only. You should not rely on them, and Juro is not liable for any reliance on them. The templates might contain errors, including unlawful provisions and might create risks and liabilities if used. The templates are not legal advice, nor a substitute for it. By accessing any template, you accept these terms and agree that any use is at your own risk.
Securing sales and maintaining customer trust is paramount for businesses. Use this free terms and conditions of sale template to simplify your sales process.Â 
The relationship between businesses and their customers is the bedrock of commerce, and this relationship is often governed by terms and conditions of sale.Â 
These terms dictate the conditions under which a product or service is sold and set the groundwork for a successful business relationship.
So, what are terms and conditions of sale? Why are they essential, when should they be used, what should they encompass, and how can they be managed effectively? Let's dive in.
What are terms and conditions of sale?
Terms and conditions of sale, often abbreviated as T&Cs, are the stipulations and guidelines under which a product or service is sold.Â 
They define the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both the seller and the buyer. These terms cover aspects like product details, pricing, delivery timelines, return policies, warranties, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
How do terms and conditions of sale work?
Once both partiesâ the seller and the buyerâ agree upon and sign the terms and conditions, they become legally binding. These terms then govern the sales relationship, outlining the duties and rights of both parties.Â 
For instance, the T&Cs will specify the product or service details, the agreed price, and the conditions under which a return or refund might be possible.
At their essence, terms and conditions serve as a roadmap for the sales relationship, offering a transparent framework for both parties to interact.Â 
If either side fails to uphold their end of the agreement, the other can seek remedies, which might include legal action.
When do you need to use terms and conditions of sale?
Terms and conditions should be in place whenever a business sells a product or service. Whether it's a one-time sale or a long-term service contract, having clear T&Cs ensures both parties understand their obligations and rights.Â 
They are especially crucial for significant sales or long-term business relationships to minimize potential disputes or misunderstandings.
What should terms and conditions of sale include?
Identification of parties. 
Clearly state the seller and the buyer, including their legal names, business structures, and primary places of business.
Description of goods/services.
 Detail the specific products or services being sold, including any relevant specifications or features.
Price and payment terms. 
Clearly specify the price and any associated taxes or fees. Outline payment terms, including due dates and accepted payment methods.
Delivery terms.
 Detail the delivery method, timeline, location, and who bears the risk during transit.
Return and refund policy.
 Outline the conditions under which returns are accepted and refunds are issued.
Warranties and guarantees. 
Specify any warranties or guarantees offered with the product or service.
Limitation of liability.
 Define any limitations on the seller's liability concerning the product or service.
Dispute resolution. 
Specify the methods for resolving disputes, whether through mediation, arbitration, or litigation.
Governing law.
 State the jurisdiction governing the T&Cs and where any legal proceedings would take place.
Amendments.
 Outline the process for making changes to the terms and conditions.
Traditional management of terms and conditions of sale
Traditionally, sales teams manage terms and conditions using various tools:
Draft the T&Cs in word processors like Microsoft Word.
Send the document for internal 
review 
via communication platforms.
Share updated versions with customers via email.
Negotiate terms with revisions in the document.
Convert the final version to PDF.
Use
 eSigning
 tools for formal agreement.
Store the signed document in shared drives.
This process can be cumbersome and disjointed, leading to inefficiencies. Modern contract management platforms, like Juro, offer a streamlined approach, allowing businesses to manage their terms and conditions from start to finish within a single platform.Â 
Features like 
automated templates
, in-platform commenting, mobile-responsive eSignature, and a secure contract repository make the process seamless and efficient.
