                UNITED STATES TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
            




1. 
APPLICABILITY.


These United States Terms and Conditions of Sale (“Terms”) apply to the purchase by the buyer (“Buyer”) from seller (“Seller”) of hardware and equipment manufactured by the Seller (“Equipment”), software developed by the Seller (“Software”), hardware and software manufactured or developed by a third party (“Third Party Products,” and together with Equipment and Software, “Products”), and services provided by the Seller (“Services”), each of which is identified in the accompanying quotation, credit application, proposal, order acknowledgement, or invoice (the “Sales Confirmation”).These Terms and the Sales Confirmation comprise the entire agreement between the parties (collectively, the “Agreement”), except as hereafter modified by Seller in writing and signed by Seller’s representative (including any applicable dealer, reseller, distributor, sales representative, or similar agreement between Buyer and Seller) (a “Superseding Agreement”). Buyer accepts these Terms by signing and returning Seller’s quotation, by sending a purchase order in response to the quotation, by submitting instructions to Seller to ship the Product or by accepting or paying for the Product or Service. No additional or different terms, conditions or warranties other than those identified in the quotation and no agreement or understanding, oral or written, in any way purporting to modify the terms and conditions, whether contained in Buyer's purchase order or shipping release forms, or elsewhere, shall be binding on Seller unless hereafter made in writing, signed by Seller's authorized representative, and specifically referencing these Terms and stating that it modifies them. Buyer is hereby notified of Seller’s express rejection of any terms inconsistent with these Terms or to any other terms proposed by Buyer. Neither Seller's subsequent lack of objection to any terms, nor the delivery of the products or services, shall constitute an agreement by Seller to any such terms. Trade custom, trade usage and past performance are superseded by these Terms and shall not be used to interpret these Terms.


2. 
PRICE; PAYMENT.


a. 
All purchases and related payments will be in US Dollars unless otherwise stated on the applicable Product or Service price list or Sales Confirmation. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, prices may be adjusted by Seller, upon notice to Buyer, prior to shipment for products or services supplied hereunder or any time, for all other costs, regardless of whether a proposal, quotation or purchase order has been accepted, acknowledged or otherwise agreed, to take into account increases in the cost of raw materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, electronic components), difficulties in securing products, changes in law, increases in labor rates or Taxes (as defined below), Trade Restrictions (as defined below), government actions, or to cover any unforeseen or other extra cost elements. The term “Trade Restrictions” is defined as any additional or new tariff/duty, quota, tariff-rate quota, or cost associated with the withdrawal of tariff/duty concessions pursuant to a trade agreement(s).


b. 
. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all stated prices are exclusive of, and Buyer agrees to pay any taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, false alarm assessments, permits and levies or other charges imposed and/or enacted by a government, however designated or imposed (collectively, “Taxes”). Any Taxes related to the products and/or services purchased pursuant to this Agreement are the responsibility of Buyer (excluding taxes based on Seller’s net income), unless Buyer presents an exemption certificate acceptable to Seller and the applicable taxing authorities. If possible, Seller will bill Taxes as a separate item on the invoice presented to Buyer. In the event Seller is required to pay any such taxes or other charges, Buyer shall reimburse Seller therefor on demand. If any exemption certificate presented by Buyer is held to be invalid, then Buyer will immediately pay Seller the amount of the Tax and any penalties and interest related thereto. At any time prior to shipment, Seller shall be entitled to an increase in time and money for any costs that it incurs directly or indirectly that arise out of or relate to changes in taxes, tariffs, duties or similar charges due to such changes.


c.  
All payment terms set forth in these Terms are subject to Seller’s approval of Buyer’s credit, in Seller’s discretion; if such approval is withheld, payment will be due in advance of Seller’s performance on the date set forth in the Sales Confirmation. Unless otherwise set forth in the Sales Confirmation, Buyer will pay all invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days following the date of Seller’s invoice. Invoices shall be paid by Buyer via electronic delivery via EFT/ACH in accordance with written instructions separately provided by Seller (as may be updated by Seller in writing from time  to time), unless an alternative payment method is agreed to by Seller in writing. Buyer shall be responsible for confirming payment instructions with their Seller account representative and shall bear the risk of loss from sending payment using unauthorized instructions. In the event payment is not received when due, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, Seller reserves the right to immediately stop performing any services, withhold deliveries of 
Products and other materials, terminate or suspend any software licenses provided hereunder, and/or terminate this Agreement. In addition, Buyer shall automatically incur, and agrees to pay, the following additional costs and charges on any amounts that are not paid when due: (i) interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by law (except for accounts in the European Union, where late payment interest rate shall be the base interest rate of the European Bank plus 10 percentage points), from the applicable due date until paid; (ii) all of Seller’s costs of collection, including (1) actual out of pocket expenses and (2) a collection fee of twenty-five percent (25%) of the past due amount if collected through a collection agency or attorney and thirty-five percent (35%) if litigation is commenced to collect such past due amount; and (iii) for accounts in the European Union, a fixed indemnity per past due invoice of €40.00. Seller reserves all other rights granted to a seller under the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) (or equivalent law in the applicable jurisdiction) for Buyer’s failure to pay for the Products, Services or any other breach by Buyer of these Terms. Invoicing disputes must be identified in writing within 21 days of the date of invoice.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.


The parties hereby incorporate by reference the requirements of 41 C.F.R. §§ 60-1.4(a), 60-300.5(a), 60-741.5(a) and 29 C.F.R. Part 471, Appendix A to Subpart A, if applicable. The Seller and Buyer shall abide by the requirements of 41 C.F.R. §§ 60-1.4(a), 60-300.5(a), 60-741.5(a) and 29 C.F.R.

22. 
MISCELLANEOUS.


a. Buyer acknowledges that is has not been induced to purchase any of the Products from Seller by any representation or warranty not expressly set forth in these Terms. These Terms, the Sales Confirmation and any Superseding Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all existing agreements and all other oral or written communications between them concerning its subject matter. If there is a conflict between the provisions of the Sales Confirmation, the Superseding Agreement and these Terms, then the terms of the Sales Confirmation will govern. No waiver by Seller of any of the provisions of these Terms is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing that specifically references these Terms and is signed by Seller. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from these Terms operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder precludes any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The Section headings contained in these Terms are for convenience only and will not affect the interpretation of any provision. If any provision of these Terms is held to be prohibited or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. Buyer will not assign any quotation or accepted order for the Products, in whole or in part, without Seller’s prior written consent. Buyer agrees that Seller may scan, image or otherwise convert these Terms into an electronic format of any nature. Buyer agrees that a copy of these Terms produced from such electronic format is legally equivalent to the original for any and all purposes, including litigation. All terms that by their nature are intended to survive shall survive any cancellation or expiration of these Terms or any purchase order or Sales Confirmation.


b. Seller expressly disclaims any requirement, understanding or agreement, whether express or implied, contained in any Buyer purchase order, shipping release form, policy, code of conduct or elsewhere, that any of Seller’s personnel be vaccinated against Covid-19 under any federal, state or local law, regulation or order applicable to government contracts or subcontracts, including, without limitation, Presidential Executive Order 14042 (“Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors”) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.223-99 (“Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors”), unless and solely to the extent that such requirement is expressly set forth in a written agreement manually signed by an authorized officer of Seller.
