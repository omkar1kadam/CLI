1. Scope of Applicability
1.1
 These General Terms and Conditions of Sale (âGTCSâ) apply to all sales of goods by us notwithstanding any conflicting, contrary or additional terms and conditions in any purchase order or other communication from you. No such conflicting, contrary or additional terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted by us unless and until we expressly confirm our acceptance in writing.

We may in our sole discretion at any time change agreed payment terms without notice by requiring payment cash in advance or cash on delivery, bank guarantee, letter of credit or otherwise.
3.4
 If you fail to pay any invoice within seven calendar days of the due date of payment, we may suspend delivery of any purchase order or any remaining balance thereof until payment is made or terminate delivery of any purchase order or any remaining balance thereof by providing written notice of termination to you within seven calendar days of the expiration of the grace period. Further, we may charge you interest from the due date to the date of payment at the rate of 1 Â½ % per month. This shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights or remedies to which we are or may be entitled at law or in equity.

 We warrant that upon delivery and for a period of twenty-four months from the date of delivery goods purchased hereunder will conform in all material respects to the applicable manufacturerâs specifications for such goods and will be free from material defects in workmanship, material and design under normal use. The warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse, negligent handling, lack of reasonable maintenance and care, accident or abuse by anyone other than us.
6.2
 With respect to goods which do not conform to the warranty our liability is limited, at our election, to (i) refund of the purchase price for such goods less a reasonable amount for usage, (ii) repair of such goods, or (iii) replacement of such goods; provided, however, that such goods must be returned to us, along with acceptable evidence of purchase, within fourteen calendar days after you discovered the lack of conformity or ought to have discovered it.
6.3
 We make no other warranty, express or implied, with respect to goods delivered hereunder, and the warranty constitutes our sole obligation in respect of any lack of conformity of goods delivered hereunder (except title). In particular, we make no warranty with respect to the merchantability of goods delivered or their suitability or fitness for any particular purpose.
7. Intellectual Property Rights Infringement
7.1
 If any goods delivered hereunder are held to infringe a third partyâs patent, utility model, design, trademark or other intellectual property right and you are enjoined from using same, we will, at our option and expense, (i) procure for you the right to continue using the goods; (b) replace the goods with non-infringing substitutes provided that such substitutes do not entail a material diminution in performance or function; (c) modify the goods to make them non-infringing; or (d) refund the purchase price of the goods less a resonable amount for usage. The foregoing states our sole liability for intellectual property rights infringement.

Your recovery from us for any claim shall not exceed the purchase price for the goods giving rise to such claim irrespective of the nature of the claim, whether in contract, tort, warranty or otherwise.
8.2
 We shall not be liable for any claims based on our compliance with your designs, specifications or instructions or repair, modification or alteration of any goods by parties other than us or use in combination with other goods.

10.1
 The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these GTCS or to any contracts of sale entered into between us.
10.2

 Should any provision of these GTCS be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision may be modified by such court in compliance with the law giving effect to the intent of the parties and enforced as modified.

10.4
 These GTCS and all contracts of sale entered into between us shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provisions. Any suits, actions or proceedings that may be instituted by either of us against the other shall be instituted exclusively before the competent courts of Denmark, however, without prejudice to our right to bring suits, actions or proceedings in any other court which would have jurisdiction if this provision had not been incorporated into these GTCS.

Table of Contents
What are general terms and conditions of sale?
The general terms and conditions of sale encompass the rules and guidelines governing the sale of a product or service. They outline the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both the seller and the buyer.Â 
These terms address product specifics, pricing, delivery schedules, return policies, warranties, and how to resolve disputes.Â 
Whether self-employed and engaged in selling products or offering services, or youâre part of a larger organization, having well-crafted general terms and conditions is crucial.Â 
These terms establish the framework for the relationship between those involved in the contract, clearly defining each party's rights and responsibilities.Â 
While it might be tempting (and super easy) to copy/paste general terms and conditions from other websites, this isnât a good idea. These terms play a crucial role in defining the rights and responsibilities of both the seller and the buyer.Â 
Think of it as a personalized agreement. Tailoring these terms to fit your unique business context ensures a fair and accurate framework for everyone involved.
â
How do terms and conditions of sale work?
At their core, terms and conditions function as a roadmap for the sales relationship. They provide a transparent framework for both parties to navigate.Â 
If either party fails to fulfill their obligations, the other has the right to seek remedies. And yes, that could be legal action.Â 
Once the seller and the buyer agree and sign the terms and conditions, these terms become legally binding. They become the guiding principles for the sales relationship, clearly outlining the duties and rights of both parties.Â 
That means that the general terms and conditions will spell out details about the product or service, the mutually agreed-upon price, and the conditions for potential returns or refunds.
â
When do you use general terms and conditions of sale?
Your terms and conditions are your GPS for every business transaction, whether a one-time purchase or a long-term service commitment.Â 
These ensure that both the buyer and seller are on the same page, defining the rules of engagement and preventing potential detours into dispute territory.
â
What clauses should general terms and conditions of sale include?
Here are key 
clauses
 that constitute a robust set of terms and conditions, ensuring both parties travel the business landscape with transparency, understanding, and a solid framework for resolution when needed.
Payment terms: 
Determine the preferred payment structure, such as advance payments, full payment upon completion, or installment plans, ensuring realism for both parties.
Default interest clause: 
Protect against late payments by specifying a default interest rate, typically between 8% and 12%, applied from the due date without prior notice.
Penalty clause: 
Introduce a compensation clause for non-performance, allowing fixed compensation for losses, capped at a percentage of the principal sum, with a reasonable minimum amount.
Retention of title clause: 
Reserve ownership rights until full payment is received, ensuring goods remain the seller's property until the invoice is settled.
Transport, delivery, and transfer of risk clause:
 Define the transfer of ownership to resolve disputes, which is particularly useful in determining ownership in case of disagreements.
Cancellation period and return of goods clause: 
Establish guidelines for 
cancellations
 and returns, specifying conditions and procedures for damaged or faulty products.
Defective products clause: 
Predefine the procedure for handling faulty products, outlining return and refund conditions based on responsibility (supplier or courier).
Legality clause: 
Designate the 
jurisdiction
 and applicable law, clarifying legal proceedings and ensuring mutual understanding.
Liability clause:
 Limit liability in specific cases, such as 
force majeure
, preventing overly broad definitions for valid application.
Personal data clause:
 If collecting 
personal data
, specify its use, duration of retention, and adherence to privacy regulations, ensuring transparency.
Acceptance and enforceability: 
Ensure the client accepts general terms and conditions before the contract conclusion, providing communication and consent through visible presentation, signatures, or online acceptance mechanisms.
â
Is it mandatory to provide general terms and conditions?
While not legally required, having general terms and conditions is highly advisable for businesses.Â 
Without them, rights and obligations are limited, and this limited framework may be less effective for your situation.Â 
Invest in tailor-made general terms and conditions aligned with your company to mitigate potential disadvantages, providing a comprehensive and customized legal framework. You can do that with the template above.Â 
When the general terms and conditions of sale arenât met or mandatory information is missing, you could be subject to fines or other repercussions.Â 
â
How should the GTCs be included?
Before entering into any contract, the other party must be informed about your general terms and conditions.Â 
Their approval is either implicitly or explicitly given through a signature on the terms or a document referencing them. A checkbox with the text "I accept the general terms and conditions" and a link to the terms is commonly used online.Â 
General terms and conditions can be communicated through various means, including physical (paper) or digital (website information). These are typically found in pre-contractual and contractual documents and other related materials.
