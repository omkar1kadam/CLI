Customer further agrees to: (a) maintain the confidentiality and security of passwords and abide by any access protocols or credential requirements set by Instructure; (b) obtain from Users any consents necessary under this Agreement or to allow Instructure to provide the Service; (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Service; (d) notify Instructure promptly of any such unauthorized access or use of which it learns; (e) cooperate reasonably in all respects with respect to implementation, access, support, and maintenance of the Service; and (f) ensure that a current email address is associated with each User’s account. 

	 


Representations. 
Each party represents that (a) it has the power and authority to validly enter into this Agreement, (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by such party, (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not violate or conflict with any other agreement, license, or obligation of such party, (d) it has not received or been offered any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from or on behalf of any employees or agents of the other party in connection with this Agreement, and (e) it is financially solvent and has the ability to perform its obligations hereunder.
 

	 


Instructure Warranties
. Instructure warrants that: (a) it shall implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to secure its facilities and systems from unauthorized access and to secure the Customer Content; (b) the functionality or features of the Service and Support may change but will not materially degrade during the Term; and (c) the Service will materially conform to its then-current documentation. As Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for Instructure’s breach of the warranties set forth in this Section 5: (i) Instructure shall correct the non-conforming Service at no additional charge to Customer; or (ii) in the event Instructure is unable to correct such deficiencies after good-faith efforts, Instructure shall refund Customer amounts paid that are attributable to the defective Service from the date Instructure received such notice. Customer must report deficiencies in writing to Instructure within thirty (30) days of their identification in order to receive any warranty remedies herein. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 5 AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT OF THE LAW, INSTRUCTURE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, INSTRUCTURE DOES NOT WARRANT THE RESULTS OR OUTCOMES FROM USE OF THE SERVICE OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. TO THE EXTENT THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY LAW, ANY AVAILABLE WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THIRTY (30) DAYS AND TO THE SERVICE REMEDIES PROVIDED BY INSTRUCTURE IN THIS SECTION 5.

	 


Fees
. As consideration for the subscription to the Service, Customer shall pay all fees set forth in an Order Form (“
Fees
”) annually in advance, thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice or as otherwise agreed to in the Order Form. All Fees owed by Customer are exclusive of, and Customer shall pay all applicable sales, use, VAT, excise, withholding, and other taxes that may be levied in connection with this Agreement. Instructure reserves the right (in addition to any other rights or remedies Instructure may have) to discontinue the Service and to suspend all Users’ and Customer’s access to the Service if any Fees are overdue until such amounts are paid in full. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all Fees are non-refundable.

	 


Service Standard
. Instructure will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each Service available with an annual uptime percentage of at least 99.9% (“
Service Commitment
”). In the event Instructure does not meet the Service Commitment, Customer will be eligible to receive a service credit as described below. The maximum amount of the credit is 1/12 of the annual subscription Fees paid and attributable to the Service that is unavailable for a twelve (12) month period. The service credit is calculated by taking the number of hours the applicable Service was unavailable below the Service Commitment, and multiplying it by 3% of 1/12 of the applicable annual subscription Fees. Any days prior to Customer’s initial use of the Service will be deemed to have had 100% availability. Any unavailability used to calculate a prior service credit cannot be used for any future claims. The Service Commitment does not apply to any scheduled outages, standard maintenance windows, force majeure, and outages that result from any technology issue not originating from Instructure. Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the Service Commitment in this Section 7 will be for Instructure to provide a credit as provided in this Section 7; on the condition that Customer notifies Instructure in writing of such claim within thirty (30) days of becoming eligible for such claim.

Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its activities under this Agreement, including with respect to personally identifiable information from records that are subject to applicable privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended (“
Personal Information
”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall not make the Service available to any person or entity that: (a) is located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo; or (b) is listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Usage Data
”) may be used by Instructure for the purposes of analysis, including statistical analysis, trend analysis, creation of data models, and creation of statistical rules. Such Usage Data will only be used in its aggregated or anonymized form and such results may be used by Instructure for any lawful purpose not otherwise excluded by this Agreement. As between the parties, Instructure owns the Usage Data. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Usage Data does not include Customer Content or any information that identifies or can be reasonably used to identify an individual person or Customer.

EACH PARTY AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COSTS OF DELAY, LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, RECORDS OR INFORMATION, COST(S) OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, AND ANY FAILURE OF DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE), EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR A PARTY’S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 17.1, EACH PARTY’S CUMULATIVE MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. 

	 


Confidentiality
. Each party acknowledges that it or any entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries’ controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party (an “
Affiliate
”) may disclose (in such capacity the “
Disclosing Party
”) Confidential Information to the other party or its Affiliates (in such capacity, the “
Receiving Party
”) in the performance of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Receiving Party shall: (a) keep the Confidential Information disclosed by the other party confidential; (b) use Confidential Information only for purposes of fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights hereunder; and (c) disclose such Confidential Information only to the Receiving Party’s employees or Affiliates who have a need to know and only for the purposes of fulfilling this Agreement or to the extent required by law. As used herein, “
Confidential Information
” means any and all non-public, confidential and proprietary information, data, or know-how, including all Personal Information and information about the Disclosing Party’s businesses, operations, finances, properties, employees, relationships with third parties, plans, trade secrets, and other intellectual property and all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, summaries, notes, reports, memoranda, interpretations, data, and other materials which contain or are generated from the Confidential Information, whether disclosed in writing, orally, electronically, or by other means, and whether or not identified as confidential. . For the avoidance of doubt, any non-public aspect of the Service will be considered the Confidential Information of Instructure. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party by a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is identified by the Disclosing Party in writing as no longer confidential and proprietary. Notwithstanding the restrictions above, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information pursuant to law, regulation, subpoena or court orders, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies the Disclosing Party in writing prior to making any such disclosure to permit the Disclosing Party an opportunity to prevent disclosure or seek an appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Receiving Party agrees to cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking such order or other remedy. The Receiving Party further agrees that if the Disclosing Party is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required (based on the advice of counsel) and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information. Further, any information obtained by monitoring, reviewing, or recording is subject to review by law enforcement organizations in connection with investigation or prosecution of possible criminal or unlawful activity on the Service as well as to disclosures required by or under applicable law or related government agency actions. Instructure will also comply with all court orders or subpoenas involving requests for such information. 

	 


Proprietary Rights
. As between Customer and Instructure, the Instructure Intellectual Property is, and shall at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of Instructure. Instructure shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Instructure Intellectual Property. “
Instructure Intellectual Property
” means: (a) the Service; (b) all improvements, changes, enhancements, and components thereof; (c) all other proprietary materials of Instructure and/or its licensors; and (d) all other intellectual property owned by Instructure including, but not limited to, all copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade names, trade secrets, specifications, methodologies, documentation, algorithms, criteria, designs, report formats, and know-how, as well as any underlying source code and object code related thereto. 

	 


Term and Termination
. The term of this Agreement is specified in the Order Form (“
Term
”) and shall continue for its full duration unless earlier terminated by a party in accordance with this Section 15. In addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available, either party may terminate this Agreement for a material breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party if such material breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. In the event the Agreement is terminated, all Order Forms are simultaneously terminated. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) Customer shall immediately cease using the Service; and (b) in connection with certain aspects of the Service that feature an export function Customer may export the Customer Content by using the export feature within the Service for a period of three (3) months from termination, after which Instructure shall have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Content. 

	 


Suspension of Service
. Instructure may suspend a User’s access to the Service for a violation of Section 3 of this Agreement, any applicable law, or third-party rights to the extent and for the duration necessary to address any such violation. Instructure will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Customer in advance of any suspension unless such violation may cause direct harm to the Service or may result in liability to Instructure. Customer agrees that Instructure will not be liable to Customer or a User if Instructure exercises its suspension rights as permitted by this Section 16. 

	 


Indemnification
.
	


Instructure will indemnify and defend Customer from and against any and all losses, liabilities, and claims (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any claim by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of that third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Instructure shall not be obligated to indemnify Customer if such infringement or misappropriation claim arises from: (a) the Customer Content; (b) Customer’s or User’s misuse of the Service; or (c) Customer’s or User’s use of the Service in combination with any products, services, or technology not provided by Instructure. If a claim of infringement or misappropriation is made, Instructure may, in its sole discretion: (i) modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing; (ii) obtain a license permitting continued use of the Service; or (iii) terminate the Agreement with no liability to Customer, other than Instructure’s obligation to indemnify hereunder, and return the unused portion of any prepaid Fees. Customer will indemnify and defend Instructure from and against any and all losses, liabilities, and claims (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any claim by a third party alleging: (z) the Customer Content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of that third party; or (y) use of the Service by Customer or any User in violation of this Agreement or the AUP. 

		 


The party seeking indemnification (the "
Indemnified Party
") shall provide the other party (the "
Indemnifying Party
") with prompt written notice upon becoming aware of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder and shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in the defense or investigation of any claim, suit or proceeding. The Indemnifying Party, at its option, will have sole control of such defense, provided that the Indemnified Party is entitled to participate in its own defense at its sole expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such claim, suit, or proceeding without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, except that the Indemnifying Party may without such consent enter into any settlement of a claim that resolves the claim without liability to the Indemnified Party and without impairment to any of the Indemnified Party's rights or requiring the Indemnified Party to make any admission of liability.

		 






General
. Each party acknowledges that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to unauthorized use of proprietary assets, will cause irreparable injury to the other party, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and the other party would not have an adequate remedy at law. Each party therefore agrees that the other party shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement. Each party waives any requirement that the other party post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Any legal notice by a party under this Agreement shall be in writing and either personally delivered, delivered by email or reputable overnight courier (such as Federal Express) or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party at the address specified in the Order Form or such other address of which either party may from time to time notify the other in accordance with this Section 18. A copy of all notices to Instructure shall be sent to: Instructure, Inc., 6330 South 3000 East, Suite 700, Salt Lake City, UT 84121, Attention: General Counsel and, if by email, to 
legal@instructure.com
. For purposes of service messages and notices about the Service, Instructure may place a banner notice or send an email to the current email address associated with an account and all notices shall be in English and deemed effective upon receipt. If Instructure is unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, earthquakes, hacker attacks, actions or decrees of governmental bodies, changes in applicable laws, or communication or power failures, such obligations will be suspended so long as those circumstances persist. This Agreement shall be interpreted, governed, and construed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Instructure is an independent contractor to Customer. If any term of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other terms remain in effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Instructure may amend, revise or update these Master Terms and Conditions at any time. Such amendment, revision or update shall be effective upon 30 days’ notice to Customer by any means reasonable to give Customer actual or constructive notice, including by posting such terms on Instructure’s website. In the event Customer does not agree with any amendment, revision or update, Customer shall give Instructure notice within 30 days of receiving actual or constructive notice from Instructure and Customer and Instructure shall negotiate in good faith to come to an agreement solely with respect to such amendment, revision or update. In the event Customer does not give notice to Instructure, Customer’s continued use of the Service after the 30-day notice period shall indicate Customer’s agreement with any such amendment, revision or update. The Parties agree that: (a) this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof, and any prior representations, statements, and agreements relating thereto are superseded by the terms of this Agreement; and (b) Customer may use purchase orders or similar documents only as proof of acceptance of each Order Form and for convenience only, and all terms and conditions (preprinted or otherwise and regardless of how referenced) shall be void and of no effect. Any attempt by Customer to assign this Agreement, in whole or part, to any entity, without Instructure’s prior written consent shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Any failure by either party to enforce the other party's strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement. Customer agrees to allow Instructure to use its name, logo, and non-competitive use details in both text and pictures in its various marketing communications and materials, in accordance with Customer’s trademark guidelines and policies. Any terms that by their nature survive termination or expiration of this Agreement will survive (including, but not limited to, Sections 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 18).
